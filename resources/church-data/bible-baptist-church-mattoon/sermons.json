    "body": "Genesis 12 marks a turning point in this book. You can essentially divide Genesis into two major sections with four defining features apiece. Genesis 1-11 is categorized by four great events: Creation, the Fall of Man, the Flood, and the Tower of Babel. These are all macro level events that concern humanity in general. Starting in Genesis 12 and running all the way through Genesis 50, the focus shifts to four great people: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The book shifts from macro level to micro level, as we move from dealing with humanity in general and instead zone in on the founding of the nation of Israel, God’s chosen people. That all begins here with the calling of Abram, who later became Abraham. \n\nAbraham is often considered one of the giants of the faith and a very important person in Scripture. He is mentioned by name 285 times in the Bible. There is a lot we can learn from his life. Before God called him, Abraham lived in Ur of the Chaldees, in what is now modern day Iraq. It was a city of great idolatry. We talked a couple of weeks ago about the Tower of Babel, and how it was likely a giant ziggurat that was built in defiance of God. In Abraham’s day, there was a ziggurat in Ur of the Chaldees, which was dedicated to the worship of a moon goddess named Nanna. The ruins of this ziggurat were actually excavated in the 1920s and 1930s, and Saddam Hussein partially reconstructed what was left of it. It’s still there in Iraq to this day.\n\nWe don’t know why the Lord chose Abraham. The Bible does not give us insight into God’s thought processes here, but we can be sure it was an amazing act of His grace. Why did God save any of us? It’s all a result of His mercy and grace toward us because of Jesus Christ and His death, burial, and resurrection. It’s not a matter of merit. Abraham’s journey as a believer began the same way all of ours do—by grace through faith. It is the gift of God. Tonight, we are going to look at Abraham’s journey as a believer, and I think we’ll find that it mirrors our own journey in many ways.\n\n[Read Genesis 12:1-20]\n\nThere are two aspects of Abraham’s journey as a believer, and we’ll deal with a few points about each of them. First, we see Abraham…\n\nI. Following the Lord (Gen. 12:1-9) – Abraham’s journey starts off well. God calls him to leave everything behind and go to a land that He would reveal to him. This is a great step of faith because the Lord did not tell him exactly where he was going [Hebrews 11:8]. Can you imagine what that conversation must have been like as Abraham tries to explain to his friends and family why he’s packing up and moving? \n\nWe’re going to have a quick English quiz here. Every complete sentence must have two parts: A subject and a predicate. The subject in this sentence is “Abraham.” What’s the predicate? “Obeyed.” If we reduce this sentence down to its simplest form, it would tell us, “By faith Abraham…obeyed.” Faith and obedience go together. The way you prove you believe something is that you act on it [Ex. of giving a gold dollar]. How did Abraham prove he believed God’s promise that He would give him a land that He would show him? He got up and left. We can’t claim to be living by faith if we’re not willing to obey Him. We say we believe the Bible is God’s Word. How do we prove it? We read it, we live it, we proclaim it. We say we believe God answers prayer. How do we prove it? We pray. We say we believe being a member of a local church is important. How do we prove it? We faithfully attend church. You get the idea.\n\nA. The Promises (12:1-3) – These first three verses of Genesis 12 are what is known by some as the Abrahamic Covenant. This is the promise that the Lord made to Abraham and to his descendants after him. It is an unconditional promise, meaning that there was nothing required on Abraham’s part in order to receive it. God took it all upon Himself to fulfill every aspect of it. There are three things that the Lord promised to Abraham here:\n\n1. Land – First of all, we need to understand that this was a literal, earthly land. This was not a figure of speech or a picture of heaven. God promised to give a specific area of land to Abraham and his descendants. He details the dimensions of the land to Abraham later, but He does not give any specifics here. The entire territory promised to Abraham extends from the Nile River to the Euphrates River. Israel has never completely possessed the entirety of the land that God promised to them, but one day they will, when Jesus Christ returns to reign on the earth. God always keeps His promises, so we can be assured He will keep this one, too.\n\n2. Nation – The Lord promises to make a great nation out of Abraham. It is interesting to note that God promised two things to him that he currently did not possess and had no hopes of possessing on his own. The Lord promised to give Abraham a land that, from a human perspective, did not belong to him. The Canaanites lived in that land. God also promised to make a great nation out of Abraham, even though he did not have any children. On top of that, he was 75 years old, and his wife Sarah was 65 years old. Through the eyes of flesh, Abraham’s prospects may have seemed dim, but through the eyes of faith, his future could not be any brighter. As William Carey once said, “The future is as bright as the promises of God.”\n\n3. Blessing – This is a multifaceted blessing. First, God promises to make Abraham’s name great, and He has certainly fulfilled that. Even to this day, the name of Abraham is a name that garners great respect by Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike. Even secularists have shown great admiration for Abraham. Next, the Lord promises not only to bless Abraham, but to make Abraham himself a blessing. The life of Abraham would bring great blessing to those around him, particularly to those who bless him in return. “I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee.” Throughout history, any world power that lifted up its hands against the Jews has been destroyed, whether you’re talking about Babylon, Greece, the Roman Empire, the Nazis, or the Soviet Union. You cannot side against God’s people and expect to come out on top. That’s why it’s very important for America to continue to be an ally to Israel. One of the most dangerous things President Obama has done is consistently side with the Arabs and Palestinians over Israel in Middle Eastern conflicts. That has never ended well for anyone.\n\nFinally, the Lord promised that all the families of the earth would be blessed in Abraham. The perfect fulfillment of this promise came through Jesus Christ, who was born on earth as a descendant of Abraham. Salvation is available to everyone everywhere because of the blood of Jesus.\n\nB. The Pilgrimage (12:4-9) – After receiving those promises from the Lord, Abraham obeys and heads out, along with his wife Sarah, his nephew Lot, and all of his household servants. This would not have been an easy trip. It was about 400 miles from Ur to the land of Canaan, and you had to go the long way around. You couldn’t take a straight shot there because there was a large desert in between. You had to go up and around to get there. It reminds us that the Christian life is not always a straight shot. Sometimes we get detoured and sidetracked, but Abraham did not let that stop him. He eventually made it into the land of Canaan. There are two things we can see that characterized his pilgrimage from Ur to Canaan:\n\n1. He journeyed by faith (Heb. 11:13-16) – We already talked before about how Abraham left without knowing exactly where he was going. Life is unpredictable. We don’t know what it has in store for us. Circumstances change all the time. It has been said that “change is the one constant in life.” However, there is something as a Christian we can put confidence in to never change, and that’s God and His Word. No matter what may come, the Bible will always be true and right. If you keep your eyes on the things of this world, then you will ultimately be disappointed and dissatisfied. If you set your focus on things above, then you will find contentment and satisfaction in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nThere were two things that characterized Abraham’s life. One of them was a tent. Although he lived in the land God had promised him for 100 years, the only piece of property he ever owned in the land was a cave he used to bury Sarah when she died. Abraham was careful not to get too attached to this world. He had a far grander destination in mind, and so should we. We need to recognize that this world is not our home, and this world is not all there is. The Bible calls us pilgrims, not vagabonds. A vagabond is someone who just wanders aimlessly. A pilgrim has a destination in mind, and for us, that’s the heavenly city. When you live with an eternal perspective, it changes your priorities. You don’t live for the here and now, and the things that will be here today and gone tomorrow. You focus your attention toward things that will last forever. How much of what you’re living for will matter 50 years from now? \n\n2. He built altars – The other thing that characterized Abraham’s life was an altar. Pretty much everywhere he went, he built an altar. The altar was the place of dedication and sacrifice. It was a landmark to signify that everything he had belonged to the Lord. Abraham did not want to hold anything back from Him. Do we have the same mentality? Is there anything in your life that you’re not willing to let God have? Is there some worry that you’re not willing to let God take care of? Is there something of value where you say, “God, You can have nearly anything, but You can’t have that?” It doesn’t necessarily have to be anything material. Is there some sin you know you should not be committing, but you’re not willing to let go of it? Your life will be so much better if you just follow Abraham’s example and let God have it all.\n\nNow that I’ve said all that, you may be thinking, “Wow, Abraham was a pretty incredible dude. I don’t think I could ever live like that.” However, in many ways, he’s not that different from you and me. Yes, he gives us a great example of following the Lord, but he also provides us an example of…\n\nII. Failing the Lord (Gen. 12:10-20) – Abraham was not perfect. Sometimes his faith was lacking. A famine comes in the land of Canaan, and so in order to take care of his family, Abraham goes down to Egypt to stay until the famine passes. There are many times we end up in the wrong place at the wrong time for a good reason. We can often come up with some good excuses for our sin, but that does not justify it. \n\nA. Famine – As I said before, life is unpredictable. Circumstances change. For a while, things were great in Canaan, but then a famine hits. Instead of trusting God to take care of him through the famine, Abraham decides to take matters into his own hands and heads down into Egypt. The Lord did not tell him to go there. He had promised to give him the land of Canaan, and that’s where he should have stayed. We need to be careful not to wander out of the place God wants us to be. It usually ends up causing us trouble.\n\nB. Fear – When Abraham gets into Egypt, he starts coming up with irrational fears. Many of our fears and worries are irrational. We spend a lot of time worrying about things that will never happen. Even though Sarah was 65, she was apparently still a very beautiful woman. The average lifespan was longer back then than it is now (Sarah lived to be 127 and Abraham lived to be 175), so she probably would have still been considered to be in the prime of her life. Now Abraham gets afraid that someone would kill him for Sarah’s sake. The Egyptians at least had enough respect for the institution of marriage that they would have felt obligated to kill Abraham first before taking Sarah, or at least that’s what he was thinking at the time. That leads to the third thing. \n\nC. Falsehoods – Abraham insists that Sarah claim to be his sister, which was a very selfish request. He was looking out for himself and not for her, and we see the consequences of that when Pharaoh decides he wants to take Sarah for himself. It’s amazing Sarah ever spoke to Abraham again after this. He might try to justify it by saying that what he said was technically true. Sarah was indeed Abraham’s half-sister, but a half truth is still a whole lie because the entire point of saying it was to deceive those around them. We need to be careful to avoid rationalizing sin by acting like it’s not a big deal or that it’s just a little white lie or what have you. \n\nD. Fruitlessness – This might be the saddest consequence of all. Once Pharaoh figures out what’s going on, he calls out Abraham for lying to him, and he had every right to do so. It’s a very shameful thing when a lost person has to call out a Christian for not acting the way a Christian should, because you’ve just lost your chance to be a witness to that person. I can imagine that Pharaoh would not have been very interested in hearing anything Abraham may have had to say about the Lord after all this. II Corinthians 5 declares that we are ambassadors for Christ. Whether you realize it or not, if you claim to be a Christian, you represent Jesus Christ on this earth. Lost people can’t see God, but they can see you. What they think of you will largely determine what they think of Christ. That’s why it’s important to make sure we represent Him well.\n\nE. The Faithfulness of God – In spite of Abraham’s failure, God was still faithful. Abraham gained a lot of riches and possessions during his time in Egypt (although the acquisition of a handmaid named Hagar would eventually come back to bite them), and the Lord plagued Pharaoh’s house in order to protect Sarah from being defiled. One of the amazing things about God is that He is still good to us, even when we don’t deserve it. That doesn’t mean Abraham got away with everything scot free. He had to endure the shameful rebuke of Pharaoh, and he later had to deal with all the trouble that Hagar brought. However, through it all, God took care of Abraham and used this situation to force him back to where he should have been all along in the land of Canaan.\n\nAs you can see, Abraham’s journey as a believer is not so different from our own journey as believers. We go through periods where we faithfully follow the Lord, and we go through times when we fail Him. Don’t feel like the faith of Abraham is out of your reach. He may have had extraordinary faith, but he was still an ordinary believer. It was his extraordinary God that made it all possible. We serve the same God that Abraham did. Keep your eyes on Him.",

    "body": "The Bible presents us with a very interesting story here, but at the same time, it’s probably one of the less familiar or talked about incidents in Abraham’s life. He finds himself getting caught in the crosshairs of war and puts on an outstanding display of courage. I think there is a lot we can take from this passage of Scripture. I feel like the easiest way to break this down is to outline the details of the story first, and then we’ll make some practical applications afterward. \n\n1. The Rebellion (Gen. 14:1-12) – Genesis is a book of firsts, and we see a couple of firsts within this chapter. This is the first war we find mentioned in the Bible. It is not necessarily the first war ever, of course, but this is the first one we see in Scripture. We’re not going to focus too much on the specific kings listed here because we don’t know anything about them other than what the Bible tells us here. There are some scholars who speculate that Amraphel is another name for Hammurabi, a famous Babylonian king who ruled sometime during that period, but we’re not sure. The one thing of note that I found here that I thought was interesting is that Sodom’s king is named Bera, and the name “Bera” means “Son of evil.” That should give you a further idea of how wicked Sodom was at that time.\n\nAnyway, let’s focus on the details of this war. I’ll try to explain it as simply as I can. Basically how this war gets started is that these five kings, headed up by the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah (which means their territories were probably located somewhere around the Dead Sea), had been in subjugation and paying tribute to these four kings, headed up by the king of Shinar, which was the name for Babylon in those times (which means their territories were probably located somewhere in Mesopotamia, or modern-day Iraq/Iran). These five kings around the Dead Sea had been doing this for twelve years, but they decided to rebel against the four kings from Mesopotamia and stopped serving them and paying them tribute. \n\nNaturally, the four kings from Mesopotamia were not thrilled with the idea, so they decide to go teach them a lesson. They declare war on the five kings from the Dead Sea and invade their territory. These five kings quickly realize that they made a big mistake by rebelling because the four kings from Mesopotamia are wiping the floor with them. There was a reason why they were the ones in charge in the first place, after all. The five kings attempt to flee, but the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah end up falling into some slime pits in the area and getting stuck. “Slime pit” is another word for “tar pit,” so if you fell in something like that, you’d definitely be stuck with no way to get out on your own. Specifically, this is referring to bitumen, which is what asphalt concrete is made of. It’s a semi-solid form of petroleum, so the fact that the Middle East abounds in oil should come as no surprise. It’s been right there in the Bible all along. This stuff is obviously very flammable, too, so when God rains down fire from heaven onto Sodom and Gomorrah, you can imagine all the havoc all these tar pits catching fire would wreak at the same time. It’s no wonder why Abraham was able to see the billowing smoke from miles away after they were destroyed. \n\nAfter their victory, the four kings from Mesopotamia plunder the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, taking all their goods and taking several of the people captive, including Lot, who now lived in Sodom. When we last saw him in chapter 13, he had pitched his tent toward Sodom, but now he’s moved within the city limits. The temptation of sin drew him in, and so he gets caught up in the mess of this war. Charles Spurgeon said, “Those believers who conform to this world must expect to suffer for it.” That leads us into the second part of this story:\n\n2. The Rescue (Gen. 14:13-16) – Someone who had managed to escape getting caught by the four kings, probably one of Lot’s servants, finds Abraham and tells him what happened. As soon as he hears this, he puts a plan into action. He arms 318 of his servants, and he also recruits these three Amorite brothers—Mamre, Eschol, and Aner—to help him. He chases the army all the way to the city of Dan, which is basically at the northern border of Israel. We’re talking somewhere between a 100-125-mile pursuit. It would have taken them several days to catch up, but Abraham was determined to rescue his nephew.\n\nOnce he finally catches up, Abraham divides up his forces and they ambush their encampment at night. This was a very cunning strategy by Abraham. Naturally, he knows he is outnumbered, so their best bet at rescuing Lot is a surprise attack at night. He divides his forces so they can attack from several different places. Doing this, Abraham was able to mask his numbers, so the enemy would really have no idea who or how many people were attacking them. In a situation like this, the soldiers might panic and start attacking everyone in sight. After all, it’s dark and they can’t distinguish friend from foe, so it’s potentially “kill or be killed” to them. Then the troops will scatter and try to flee, dividing their numbers and keeping them disorganized, which makes it much easier to defeat them. If you read the story of Gideon’s 300 and their attack on the Midianites in Judges 6, which is a very similar setup to this one, you’ll find that’s exactly what happened there. After the troops scatter, Abraham mops them up as far as this place called Hobah, which is near Damascus in Syria, and manages to rescue Lot and the rest of the captives and retrieve their plundered goods. \n\n3. The Refusal (Gen. 14:17-24) – After the battle, the tenth and final king in this chapter appears, a man by the name of Melchizedek, who was the king of Salem (which is what is later called Jerusalem). He’s not only a king, but he’s also a priest. He brings Abraham rations for his troops to commemorate their victory and blesses him in the name of the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, as Melchizedek puts it. After receiving this gift, Abraham gives a tithe of his assets to this king-priest. \n\nWe won’t get too deep into this tonight, but if you read Hebrews 7, it explains the significance of this meeting and tells us that Melchizedek is an Old Testament picture of Jesus Christ. He is both a king and a priest who rules in Jerusalem, much like Jesus Christ one day will. Melchizedek also brought an offering of bread and wine, which can be seen as a picture of the Lord’s Supper, foreshadowing Christ’s death for us. It also explains how Jesus Christ can be both our King and our High Priest, since as someone from the tribe of Judah, He could not be a Levitical priest. Jesus Christ is a priest after the order of Melchizedek. If you read Psalm 110, which is a Messianic Psalm, it says, “Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.” The writer of Hebrews explains that this is a superior priesthood to the Levitical priesthood, which is demonstrated when Abraham, the father of the Jewish people, paid tithes to Melchizedek. You pay tithes to someone you regard as a superior. When you tithe to the Lord, you are in effect recognizing the superiority and authority of God in your life. That is what it is meant to symbolize. \n\nIn contrast to Melchizedek, from whom Abraham received gifts and to whom he gave a tithe, his reaction to meeting the king of Sodom is markedly different. Abraham vehemently refuses to take anything from him, to the point that he says he wouldn’t even take a thread from a shoelace if it was offered to him. He also does not give him any sort of tithe because he recognizes that he owes nothing to this wicked, earthly king. It’s also interesting to note that Abraham does not force his convictions on the three men who came with him. He told them that they could take a portion from the king of Sodom if they wanted to. \n\nSo what can we learn from this chapter tonight? I think there are a few lessons we can take from it:\n\n1. Being separated does not mean you have to be isolated – This is a mistake the Roman Catholic church has made with its monasteries and convents. Abraham did not live as a hermit in some monastery, nor did he live in some ivory palace looking down on the world below him. He formed bonds with these three Amorite brothers who helped him out in his time of need. We may no longer be of this world, but we are still in this world. We are never going to reach this world if we are not in and among them. That does not mean we endorse their lifestyle, but we cannot expect the world to come to us. Some of them might, but most of them won’t. \n\nAbraham was also willing to fight. There was a story of a man during World War II who refused to be drafted as a conscientious objector. When he was brought before the tribunal, the judge asked him if he would do anything to help the war effort. He refused, and when asked for his reason, he replied, “My kingdom is not of this world.” Shrewdly, the judge replied, “Very well. Then you won’t need a ration card.” \n\nThe point is that we can’t remain aloof or indifferent to the needs of the world around us. What this world needs isn’t political or social reform. It needs a spiritual awakening. It needs the Gospel. Where are they going to get it if we aren’t willing to give it to them? It’s important for us to have a testimony that they know we care about them, but we’re not going to be able to minister to their spiritual needs if we remain indifferent to their physical, mental, or emotional needs. Your testimony for Christ will be stronger if you are separated among the world instead of being completely isolated from it.\n\n2. Never give up on people, even when it seems like they aren’t responding – This lesson isn’t really overtly stated in this chapter, but it’s strongly implied. The entire reason Abraham got involved in this war in the first place was to rescue Lot. Now Lot had already separated himself from Abraham because their herdsmen couldn’t get along, and not only that, the entire reason he got captured was because he was living in Sodom, one place he absolutely should not have been. It would have been easy for Abraham to say, “Well, he got himself into that mess; he can get himself out of it. He got what he deserved,” but that’s not what he did. Lot is referred to as his brother twice in this chapter. Abraham still regarded Lot as a fellow brother, and so he was not about to give up on him, even at great risk and cost to himself. \n\nOnce again, this isn’t overtly stated in this chapter, but we see it later on. What did Lot do after Abraham risked his life to rescue him from his captors? He went right back into Sodom. When you read Genesis 19, he’s sitting in the gates of Sodom. Maybe there’s someone you care about that you’ve tried to reach, whether it’s a lost person or a backslidden Christian. No matter how much you may do for them, you never seem to be able to get through to them. Right after you get done bending over backwards to help them, it seems like they go right back into the mess you worked to get them out of. When you try to talk to them about the Lord, they turn you off. They might accept your help, but they won’t accept the Gospel.\n\nThe temptation after a while is just to say, “Forget it. I’m done. I’m tired of going out on a limb for them.” Yet even after Lot seems to spurn Abraham and goes right back into Sodom, what do we see Abraham doing a few chapters later in Genesis 18? Standing before the Lord and begging Him to spare whatever righteous people there were in Sodom and Gomorrah, undoubtedly for Lot’s sake. Even from afar, Abraham never gave up on Lot.\n\nNow we don’t know if Lot ever got his act together. From the last we saw of him in Scripture, it doesn’t seem like he did, but maybe he did at some point. Regardless, Abraham’s dedication toward helping Lot was not based on future results. He was going to help Lot and try to reach him, no matter how he responded to it. I have a tendency to think in worst case scenarios, and sometimes I feel like, “They’re just never going to respond.” And maybe they won’t. We can’t force anyone to do anything.\n\nBut maybe they will. Only God knows the future, and where are they going to end up if you give up on them? Who is going to care about their spiritual condition if you stop caring? We need to be faithful to show compassion on people and share the Gospel with them, no matter how they may respond to it. You never know. Maybe one day they’ll get it. We need to have that sort of faith.\n\n3. When you live for God, you are never alone – Does it ever feel like sometimes you’re the only one trying to live for God? It’s possible Abraham felt that way as he watched his ungrateful nephew just go right back in to what he rescued him from, but then he meets Melchizedek. We don’t know how Melchizedek found out about Abraham, but in the land of Canaan, he met someone else who was living faithfully for the one true God. \n\nAs a result, that gave Abraham the courage he needed to stand up to the king of Sodom and not give in to the temptation to take his riches. If you pay attention, Abraham uses the same titles for God that Melchizedek used just a few verses earlier. He calls Him the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth. \n\nSo when you feel discouraged or when you feel tempted, remember that you do have fellow brothers and sisters in Christ who are there for you to help you when you need it. That’s what a church is there for. We don’t live unto ourselves, and we don’t die unto ourselves. We need each other. The temptation for Christians when they go through trouble is to isolate themselves, and the last thing you should do when trouble comes is to run away from the ones who can help you the most. The devil wants to isolate us, because he knows we’re easy pickings when we’re alone. Truthfully, the Lord knows that, too, and that’s why we have churches. God sent Melchizedek to Abraham at just the right time so he would be able to stand for his convictions.",

    "body": "This is an interesting chapter that progresses at a rapid rate from Abraham to Ishmael to Isaac to Jacob. It can be a little difficult to keep up with the timeline of events because of how quickly we progress from one person to the next, but we’ll try to sort it out over the course of the message. We won’t spend much time on the particulars of the genealogies of Abraham and Ishmael because I don’t think they mean too much to us in the time and culture we live in. They’re mostly just names on a page to us, and while some historical insight into some of their descendants might be interesting, but I think there are some important principles we can glean from what God tells us about these families. I don’t have an in-depth outline here, but I just want to share some lessons that can be an encouragement to us in our Christian lives.\n\nI. The Family of Abraham (Gen. 25:1-11) – It might be surprising to learn that Abraham got remarried after Sarah passed away, and he had six more sons. It’s not a facet of his life that’s brought up much, and the Bible doesn’t give much attention to it. Still, what’s the point of having this here? What can we learn from this passage about Abraham and about our own lives?\n\nA. No matter what stage of life you’re in, you can still be fruitful – When Sarah passed away, Abraham was 137 years old, and when Isaac married Rebekah, he was 140. He’d lived a long life up to that point, and he’d accomplished great things for the Lord. He could’ve just kicked back and relaxed, but apparently, that wasn’t Abraham’s style. Now that Isaac was grown and had a family of his own to tend to, Abraham decided he wanted to raise more children. It’s not a task you normally expect a man his age to tackle, but he didn’t want to just sit back and do nothing with the rest of his life. He didn’t know he still had 35 years left to live, but he wanted to make what time he had left count for the Lord.\n\nThat should be our attitude as well. Regardless of who you are, there is still something you can do for God. If there wasn’t, you wouldn’t still be here. The fact that you are still alive on Earth means there’s still something the Lord can use you to do. Never get complacent in your Christian walk. Never stop learning and never stop attempting great things for God. \n\nWhen it describes the end of Abraham’s life in verse 8, it says he “died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years.” If you look, you’ll notice the word “of years” is in italics. That means those words are not in the original Hebrew text, but they were added by the English translators to try to clarify the meaning of the text. That word “full” in the Hebrew means “filled to satisfaction.” It’s like how you feel after you’ve had a big meal. You’re full, and you’re satisfied. When Abraham got to the end of his life, he could say that he had lived a full life to his and God’s satisfaction. Sure, it wasn’t a perfect life, but it had been one where Abraham had tried to do all he could for the glory of God. That should be our goal as well.\n\nJust because you live a long life doesn’t mean you’ll live a full life, and just because you don’t live a long life doesn’t mean you can’t live a full life. Some of the greatest men of God, both in the Bible and in recent times, have died young. Stephen was likely still a young man when he was stoned in Acts 7, but he had lived a full life. Jim Elliot and the missionaries who died attempting to reach the Indians in Ecuador did not live long lives, but they certainly lived full ones. There’s an old saying that goes, “It’s not the life in your years that count. It’s the years in your life.” [Read Psalm 92:12-15]\n\nB. Abraham remembered God’s promise – Look at verses 5-6. When the time came, Abraham gave his sons gifts and sent them away from Isaac. Why? Because he remembered God’s promise, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called.” While God had fulfilled the meaning of Abraham’s name and had truly made him a father of many nations, all the spiritual blessings and promises belonged solely to Isaac and to his seed after him. He did not want there to be any questions or squabbling amongst the other sons once he died. He made sure the matter was settled and they all understood that Isaac was the promised seed.\n\nC. Abraham went on to a better place – It sounds like a trite cliché, but verse 8 tells us that Abraham “was gathered to his people.” Where were his people? Not in the grave. They were with the Lord, and that is where he went to join them. While a lot of emphasis is made on the promised land on earth being given to Israel, Abraham never owned that land for himself and it wasn’t what he was really after. When he died, the only property he owned was the cave where he and Sarah were buried. What was Abraham really after? [Read Hebrews 11:8-16]\n\nAbraham understood that this world was not his home. He didn’t build castles. He built altars and lived in a tent. He recognized that he was merely a pilgrim on his way home. We need to be careful to avoid getting too attached to this world ourselves. Regardless of the future of America—and I believe you ought to pray for America’s future and be active in helping to make it a good one—our future as Christians is secured. That’s why I try not to worry about the upcoming election regardless of which candidate wins. It won’t stop God’s work in this world, and it won’t change who we are or what we are here to do during our time on earth. This world is not our home. We are pilgrims passing through. We can find peace in that no matter what the situation around us might be. \n\nII. The Family of Ishmael (Gen. 25:12-18) – We are given a very brief glimpse into Ishmael’s family and his descendants, and we’ll spend a very brief time on this section ourselves. I think there is only one real reason for this, and that is to show us that God always keeps His promises [Read Gen. 16:11-13, 17:20]. There were two promises that God made about Ishmael in these verses that we find fulfilled here. Verse 18 tells us that Ishmael died in the presence of his brethren. Genesis 16:12 tells us that he would dwell in the presence of his brethren. Genesis 17:20 tells us that Ishmael would beget twelve princes, and God would make a great nation of him. If you count the number of sons Ishmael has in verses 13-15, you’ll discover that the total is—you guessed it—twelve. Ishmael is also the progenitor of the Arabic people, so the Lord kept His promise in every way to him. \n\nJust as God kept His promise to Ishmael, we can trust that He will keep His promises to us. We don’t have to worry about it. You can trust what is written in God’s Word. It is still as true today as it was when it was written. “Forever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven.”\n\nIII. The Family of Isaac (Gen. 25:19-34) – After a brief interlude about Ishmael, the story transitions fully from Abraham to Isaac and Jacob. Their family life was pretty turbulent at times, often because of their own doing. Even Christian families have troubles, and they fail to be what they ought to be toward one another. There are no perfect families, but I think there are a couple of important lessons this family can teach us.\n\nA. Be persistent in prayer – As I said, sometimes it can be hard to ascertain the timeline of events in this chapter because of how quickly everything progresses. When Isaac marries Rebekah, he is forty years old. Like Sarah before her, Rebekah is barren and can’t have children. Because of this, Isaac prays for God to bless them with children, and He does. Because this is all recorded in the same verse, our tendency is to think this all happened in rapid succession, but look at verse 26. How old was Isaac when Jacob and Esau were born? He’s sixty. That mean he prayed for nearly twenty years before God finally blessed them with children. \n\nTo keep praying that long, Isaac had to believe in the power of prayer. If there’s one advantage Isaac has over Abraham and over Jacob, it’s that he didn’t resort to scheming and trying to find loopholes to accomplish God’s work. Abraham and Sarah tried to get around the problem with Hagar. Jacob’s family situation ends up being a rather convoluted mess that we don’t really have time to get into right now, but we see nothing of the sort with Isaac. He simply prays and waits and prays and waits. \n\nIs there something you’ve been praying about for a really long time? Maybe it’s for someone to be saved. Maybe it’s for a wayward child to come back. Whatever it is, don’t give up. Learn from Isaac’s example and be persistent. James 5:16 tells us that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. The results may not come immediately or as quickly as we might like, but they will come if we’ll keep at it. \n\nB. Value eternal things over temporal things – When Rebekah finally has children, she has twin boys, but regardless of how you measure it—whether physically or spiritually—they were almost polar opposites of each other. When Esau is born, he’s apparently already covered in red hair (The name “Esau” is a pun on the Hebrew word for “hairy”). Esau was basically the epitome of a manly man. He was born with a five o’clock shadow, and he grew up to be a rugged outdoorsman and hunter. It’s no wonder he was Isaac’s favorite. \n\nOn the other hand, when Jacob comes out of the womb, he grabs Esau by the heel (The name “Jacob” literally means “heel catcher,” and it also carries the idea of “supplanter” or “trickster,” and he definitely lived up to that name). In contrast to Esau, the Bible says that Jacob is a plain man and dwelled in tents. His personality was more laidback and relaxed. He was more of a homebody and apparently a mama’s boy since he was Rebekah’s favorite. Between the two, I’d have to say I probably relate more to Jacob than Esau.\n\nHowever, one day, Esau comes back from the field, and he’s exhausted. He sees Jacob making some pottage (some kind of vegetable soup, probably), and he asks Jacob to give him some. Jacob decides to take advantage of the situation and asks Esau to sell him his birthright in exchange. The birthright was very important in those days. It belonged to the firstborn son, and when the father died, it guaranteed he would get a double portion of the inheritance compared to the rest of the children. However, in Isaac’s case, the birthright was even more meaningful because it carried with it the blessings and promises that God made to Abraham. Abraham had passed that down to Isaac, and one day, Isaac would pass that on to his son. Jacob wanted those blessings and promises for himself. We can question his methods to get the birthright, but he certainly placed a high value on spiritual things.\n\nEsau, on the other hand, saw those spiritual blessings as practically worthless because he places a high value on fleshly pleasures and desires. He’s so desperate to have his hunger satisfied that he says he feels like he’s about to die, and the birthright won’t do him any good at this point, so he agrees. Esau walked away without realizing he had just purchased the most overpriced meal in history. He thought he had made a good deal, but the Bible says Esau despised his birthright. He looked down on it as worthless and useless. He had no use for the things of God…until the time came when he realized he actually did want those blessings and promises, but by then, it was too late. He had sold them for practically nothing. \n\nThe question I want to pose to you tonight is: Are you more like Jacob or more like Esau? How much value do you place on the things of God, on eternal things? We might question Jacob’s methods, but he understood the value of the birthright. He wanted to have God’s blessings in his life, and he was willing to do what it took to secure them. How far are you willing to go for the Lord? Of course, I’m not saying we should resort to underhanded tactics like Jacob, but how much can God ask of you before you say, “Whoa, that’s too much. I can’t do that. I can’t give up that?” Do we understand what’s really important in life? How much do you think about eternity and spiritual matters? How often are we burdened about reaching lost people with the Gospel of Jesus Christ before it’s too late? How much time each day, each week, each year, do we devote to Him? Only one life, so soon it will pass, only what’s done for Christ will last. \n\nMaybe you’re like Esau, and you’re just living for the here and now. You might belong to a Christian family. You might look the part and you might be able to say all the right things, but deep down, you really couldn’t care less about all that stuff. You’re more obsessed with pop culture, with work, with sports, with money, with whatever. You’ll think nothing of one day turning your back on the things of God to pursue after those lesser things. More and more young people are in that position. They get entranced by the things of the world, failing to recognize that those things eventually fade away and lose their value. One day, they’ll find themselves in Esau’s shoes, begging and pleading with tears as they look back on their lives and wish they had lived it for God instead of for themselves, but it’ll be too late. They’ll have wasted their lives. Don’t waste your life in this world. Don’t put off living for God, thinking you’ll eventually do all that stuff later on when “later on” may never come. Value what really matters and what will last for eternity.",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me again and turn to Acts 16.  Acts 16.  We are going to read verses 6-24.\n\nThis is a passage that tells us about the conversion of two people.  Two ladies. They couldn't be more different.  But the key player in this story isn't Paul - and it isn't these two ladies - it's the Holy Spirit.  It's God working.\n\nBut I do want to say something about the fact that this story talks about two ladies.  There are lots of people out there who want to paint Christians as mysogynists and sexists.  We are the ones who are holding woman down. We are a bunch of knuckle dragging neanderthals and it's the savvy people - the people who live in places like New York and California that care about women.\n\nThat's a very shallow view of history and a view that displays total ignorance of the Bible.  At the time of Christ - most of the countries of the world treated woman like dirt.  You could do to your wife whatever you wanted with no consequence.  If she messed up your breakfast  - you could kill her and it wouldn't matter.  Killing girl babies was extremely common.  Forced prostitution was extremely common.    Having more than one wife was extremely common.  Keeping concubines was extremely common.  It was totally normal for a Roman to be married more than 3 or 4 times.  Woman had no protection and no status.\n\nBut you would barely see that if you read the New Testament.  Many of the heroes of the New Testament were woman: Mary, Elizabeth, Mary Magdalene, Dorcas, Lois and Eunice, Eudioas and Syntyche and on and on.  We don't totally get their role - but their were female prophets mentioned many times in the New Testament.  The church is \"the bride of Christ\" that God loved, cherished and sacrificed for.\n\nThe early Christian church wasn't anti-woman - not at all.\n\nHere in this chapter we see two woman who couldn't be more different but they had one thing in common - God was working in their lives, drawing them to himself.\n\nNow, I want to go through this story and explain it fairly quickly because I want to get to what the story teaches us.  **It starts by telling us about Paul and Silas' journey**.  They kept running into closed doors in Turkey and God made it clear to them in a vision that he wanted them to expand their ministry to Macedonia so they traveled from Western Turkey by boat north and west until they got to a city called Phillipi.\n\nLet me give you a quick geography lesson.  Macedonia is North and East of Greece.  It sort of makes a land bridge between Greece and Turkey.  Functionally though - it's a pretty Greek place.  Many people mistakenly think that the Greek's took over the world before the Romans did - that's wrong.  Phillip the great was a Macedonian.  He just loved greek culture and spread greek culture around the world.\n\n![Map](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/47159282/pauls_second_journey1349342846464.jpg)\n\nSo they are leaving the Middle east and middle eastern culture moving into Europe and european culture.  And this first city that they go to is actually a Roman City.  It was considered a little part of Rome outside of Rome.  It was a local capitol - but never a huge city.  Think Springfield - not Chicago.  \n\nIn fact - they weren't even big enough to have a synagogue.  So, when Paul and Silas get there - they can't follow their normal pattern and preach in the synagogue - because there isn't one.  So they wait until the sabbath and they go to the river because it was customary for jews to gather by the river for prayer when their wasn't a synagogue.  \n\nAnd when they get their they meet an interesting woman - Lydia.  One of the things I learned studying this is that Lydia was probably her nickname - because it's actually the name of the place she was from.  The other name for Thyratyra was Lydia.  Thyratyra was known for purple dye.  She was from their and sold purple dye.  So it was probably a knickname or business name.\n\nAnyways, Lydia is not Jewish.  She’s a Gentile.  But she earnestly wants to worship God.  So even though she’s not Jewish  she is worshipping with the jews at the river and when she hears what Paul is saying about Jesus the Bible says *“Whose heart the Lord opened.”*  She accepts and believes the gospel and gets baptized.  Then brings that message to her house and they believe and are baptized.\n\nShe then begs Paul and his helpers to come and stay with her while they are in Philippi.\n\nSo, that’s the first woman.  A wealthy moral kind woman who was never anything but kind to Paul and his team.\n\nBut the next woman couldn’t be more different.  The story says that as they went praying they met this damsel - probably a teenage girl, who is a slave and who is demon possessed.  Her owners use her to make money by telling people she can tell the future.  So she’s some kind of psychic.\n\nWhen she sees Paul and Silas she starts following them around and yelling to whoever would hear *“These are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.”*  She follows them around doing this many days.  \n\nIf you are anything like me you might read that and think “Ok - why is that a problem?”  I mean - they ARE the servants of the most high God.  They are telling people the way of salvation.  So what is the problem?\n  \nThis girl is demon possessed.  She’s acting on the influence of demons.  I’m sure she was doing this in such a way that it really scared people and turned people off from the gospel.  So, finally Paul can’t take it any more.  The Bible says he is “grieved” but that word could mean “annoyed, miffed.”  He can’t take it - so he turns to her and says:\n\n> *”I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.”*\n\nHe was talking to the Demon.  He exorcised her.  And the Bible says \"He came out the same hour.\"  So, she was actually demon possessed and she was actually healed from it.  And she was immediately a different person.  The Bible doesn't say she got saved - but I think we can assume that she did.  \n\nWe know she was very different.  We know that because verse 18 says that her masters saw she was different.  They saw that their cash cow wasn't giving milk anymore and they got so mad about it that they incited a riot and got Paul and Silas thrown in jail.\n\nSo we have these two women, one a rich business woman who was very moral and religious and one who was a poor wretch who was a demon possessed.  But they both needed the same thing - they both needed Jesus.  They both needed salvation.\n\nNow what does God want us to learn from this story?  What are the lessons for us?  I have four of them for you this morning:\n\n# 1. God is seeking after people. \n\nJesus said in Luke 19:10\n\n> *\"For the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.\"*\n\nGod wants to save people.  He is actively seeking sinners.  He is actively looking to save people and bring them to himself.  And I think we see this crystal clear in this story.\n\nIf you were to look at the way that Paul and his team travelled -  it doesn't make sense.  Every where they went God was closing doors sending them on a very narrow line to this little city of Philippi.  Why?\n\nI think it's because there was some people in Philippi that God wanted to hear the gospel, and God was moving the pieces in place.\n\nHave you ever thought about this?  God wants to save people.  He wants people to trust Him.  \n\nYou might hate your job.  You never planned on doing it.  You never wanted to do it.  It's not what you signed up for. And you might ask God \"Why?\" Every day.  Do you know, maybe there is a Lydia at your job that God wants you to share the gospel with.\n\nOr maybe you live in a crumby neighborhood and you want to get out.  You didn't plan on going there.  Have you ever thought that maybe their is a damsel in your neighborhood that needs you to share the life changing message of the gospel?\n\nI don't know. But I do know this - God is actively working to save people.  \n\nA second thing we can learn from this is:\n\n# 2. God is seeking after all kinds of people.\n\nIf I say, God wants to save people.  That's not a very controversial statement.  Most Christians would give some agreement to that.  But when we read the Bible it's clear that God wants to save all kinds of people.\n\nMost of us rejoice when we see another Lydia come into the church.  People with property and standing.  People with morals and religion.  People with nice clothes and nice language.  People who, like Lydia, have something to offer right away.  \n\nBut when God brings us into the path of a damsel girl.  Someone with a past. Someone with the marks of sin all over them.  Someone who is openly hostile to God.  We don't even think that God would save a person like that.  But God does and God can.\n\nAnd listen, the ground is level at the foot of the cross.  God wants to save the Lydia's of this world.  Praise the Lord for the Lydia's.  But God wants to save the slave girls too.  \n\nRemember what they accused Jesus of?  They didn't say \"Jesus, we can't stand you because you just are too high and holy.\"  No, they said \"You are a friend of publicans and sinners.  You are hanging out with THOSE people.\"\n\nThink of this.  I think this is beautiful.  I can't imagine a situation where Lydia and the damsel would have anything to do with each other - but with Christ they were sisters. In Christ they were part of the same spiritual family.\n\nGod wants to save people.  All people.  The creepy people at Bagelfest.  The uppity people at the restaurant.  The religious people in the pew.  God is after all of them.\n\nA third lesson from this story is similar.\n\n# 3. God is powerful enough to save those most enslaved by Satan.\n\nThis damsel girl was demon possessed.  She was literally being led and controlled by the devil.  It's likely she was used as a prostitute too.  And she follows Paul and Silas around for many days mocking them.  I think if there was anybody you could write off and say \"nope, she's too far gone\" it's this girl.  But God saved this girl.\n\nPaul said in Romans 1:16\n\n> *\"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believe that; to the Jew first and also to the Greek.\"*\n\nThe gospel is *\"the power of God unto salvation.\"*. That word *power* is the Greek word *dunamis.*  It's the word we get \"dynamite\" from.  \n\nHebrews 4:12 says \n\n> *\"For the word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\"*\n\nBoom.  Do you know what that means?  It means the gospel changes people.  It has the power, when it is clearly presented, to turn lost men into saved men.  To turn slaves into free people.  To turn children of the devil into children of God.\n  \nBoom.  Dunamis.  The power of God.\n\nAnd let me be clear before I move onto the last point - it is THE GOSPEL that saves.  These people weren't saved because of Paul's awesome delivery.  They weren't saved because Paul added another verse to the invitation or squeezed their hand a certain way.  They were saved because of the clarity of the gospel  and by the power of God.\n\nGod wants to save people - all kinds of people - even people who are the most ensnared by Satan.\n\nOne more point and we'll be done... \n\n# 4. When God is working, Satan will be pushing back (But God is working through that too).\n\nAt the end of our text this morning Paul and Silas face a riot, are falsely accused, and then beaten and thrown in jail. \n\nSatan pushed back and pushed back hard.  But a few verses later - we see that God was working to save the Philippians jailer and his household and that couldn't happen without Paul and Silas in jail.  \n\nSometimes, when we are faced with difficulty we think \"God can't be in this - it's hard\". But just because we are facing difficulty doesn't mean we are losing the fight.  It doesn't mean we are out of control.  It's all a part of God plan.\n\nSo, what is the point of this passage?  I think if I had to sum it up in a sentence it would be this:\n\nTrust God, follow His leading and share His word. Because He is after the Lydia's and the damsel girls of this world and He will save people when we are faithful and obedient.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "As Pastor Hayden discussed last week, what Revelation is ultimately is a revelation of Jesus Christ, so it’s only fitting that the very first thing John sees is a vision of Christ in all His glory. \n\nI. Where John Was (1:9-10)\n\n--At this point, John is the last of the apostles still alive. Most Biblical scholars believe Revelation was written around A.D. 95 toward the end of the reign of Emperor Domitian, who intensely persecuted the church. According to church tradition, they attempted to boil John to death in oil, but he survived. Afterward, he was exiled to the island of Patmos, which is a rocky crag of an island in the Mediterranean Sea, about 10 miles long and 6 miles wide, where he received this vision from the Lord.\n\n--John doesn’t call himself an apostle here. He calls himself “your brother, and companion in tribulation.” He said that he was on Patmos because of the Word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ. The Greek word for “testimony” is where we get our English word “martyr.” It’s also translated as “witness” in the New Testament. \n\n--“I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day.” This is the first time that Sunday is referred to as “the Lord’s Day.” This is different from the Day of the Lord, which is what will be described throughout most of this book. The Lord’s Day is the day of worship for the church. In a sense, every day belongs to God, but this one is specially set aside for the church as the sabbath was for Israel. \n\n--John is said to be “in the Spirit,” but it is a unique situation. This isn’t just “walking in the Spirit” as we are all commanded to do in Galatians 5. It was a special condition in which he was able to receive the revelations of this book. \n\nII. What John Heard (1:10-11)\n\n--“And heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet.” The sound wasn’t a trumpet, but it had the effect of one. The trumpet was used to get people’s attention. The phrase “great voice” in the Greek is where we get the English word “megaphone.” The point of a megaphone is to amplify your voice in order to expand the reach of your voice beyond its normal limits and to grab people’s attention. \n\n--Jesus calls himself “the Alpha and Omega, the first and the last.” Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, and Omega is the last. Since Jesus is also called the Word many times by John, this is a fitting description of Himself. In English, I suppose we could also say “I am the A and the Z,” but it just doesn’t sound as cool as “Alpha and Omega.” God also calls Himself “the first and the last” in Isaiah 44:6 and 48:12. \n\n--John is commanded to write twelve different times in the book of Revelation. He was told to send what he wrote to these seven local churches in Asia Minor (modern day Turkey). I won’t go into detail about each of these churches since I’m sure Pastor Hayden will cover that when he talks about them individually in chapters 2 and 3. \n\nIII. What John Saw (1:12-16)\n\n--The number seven appears 31 times in Revelation. It is the number of completion or perfection. There are seven golden candlesticks (v. 12), seven stars (v. 16), seven angels (v. 20), seven churches (v.20). We also see seven Spirits back in v. 4.\n\n--The Bible here says that John saw seven golden candlesticks, but they were more like lampstands. This wasn’t like a menorah, where you have one stand with seven candlesticks on it. They were individual, freestanding lampstands with lamps set on them. There is an interesting contrast here with the golden lampstand that was in the Tabernacle and the Temple. That was like a menorah, which symbolized that while there were many tribes, there was still only one Israel. In the New Testament, there is no “universal church” spoken of. We see individual, local churches, represented here by these separate lampstands. \n\n--We need to remember that the light didn’t come from the lampstands themselves. The light comes from the lamp, but the stand exists to make the light more visible. As Jesus said in Matthew 5:15-16, “Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” That is our job as the church. We do not produce the light. We simply display it. Can others see the light of Christ in your life? \n\n--This is the only physical description of Jesus we find in the Bible. We don’t know anything of what He looked like when He was on earth during His first coming. Any artist’s renditions you may see are just that. They aren’t based on any factual descriptions we have of Him because they don’t exist. \n\n--John’s description of Jesus here mirrors Daniel’s description of the Ancient of Days and the Son of Man in Daniel 7:9-14. John even calls Him the Son of Man in verse 13. \n\n--“Clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.” The long clothing indicates a person of great dignity and authority. People who did not have to partake in manual labor wore long clothing. The golden girdle around the chest speaks of the fact that Jesus Christ is our great High Priest. The high priest in the Old Testament wore a girdle that had golden threads woven into it, but Christ’s is entirely made of gold. The eternal, heavenly priesthood we have in Jesus is far superior to the Levitical priesthood of the Jews. \n\n--“His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow.” This does not speak of old age, but rather of Christ’s wisdom, purity, and timelessness. Jesus is not getting “older” or becoming “old.” While He may be the Ancient of Days, He hasn’t lost a step. His power and wisdom have not been diminished one iota. \n\n--“His eyes were as a flame of fire.” Fire in the Bible often speaks of judgment and refining. When Jesus looks at us, He penetrates straight to the truth. We cannot deceive Him or hide anything from Him.\n\n--“And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace.” Brass speaks of sacrifice because the altar of sacrifice in the Old Testament was made of brass. Brass was also one of the strongest known metals in the world at that time, so it speaks of stability and power, unlike the statue in Daniel’s vision in Daniel 2, whose feet were made of iron mixed with clay and were destroyed by the Rock made without hands. There are many parallels between Daniel and Revelation. \n\n--“And his voice as the sound of many waters.” This means that when Jesus speaks, we have no choice but to listen. I don’t know if you’ve ever been to a waterfall, but those things can get loud. You can’t shout down or overpower God’s Word. \n\n--“Out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword.” This parallels Hebrews 4:12, which says, “For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” So we know that this is talking about the Word of God. Now this doesn’t necessarily mean that a sword literally came out of Christ’s mouth, but rather that His Word has that kind of power. It has the power to cut down all who hear it, especially those who attempt to oppose it. The sword spoken of here is the large broadsword, which was heavy and impossible to stop once it started coming down at you.\n\n--“And his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.” It’s like looking into the noonday sun on a perfectly clear day. This speaks of Christ’s unclouded glory. His glory was veiled by His flesh when He was on earth before, but now nothing is getting in its way. \n\nIV. How John Reacted (1:17)\n\n--“And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead.” This is the apostle whom Jesus loved, the one who leaned on His breast at the Last Supper. Yet when he sees Christ in all His glory here, his reaction is to fall to the ground. John even saw Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration, but even that was only a partial preview compared to this. This is a reminder to us that, even though God is love, He is also holy and righteous. In the purity of His presence, we can’t help but be aware of our own shortcomings and inadequacies. It should humble us. When we get a vision of Jesus as He truly is, we will put Him in His rightful place as the One who deserves the preeminence in all things. \n\nV. What Jesus Said (1:17-20)\n\n--And yet what Jesus does in response to John falling at His feet is beautiful. He laid His right hand on him and said, “Fear not.” Even as John was overwhelmed by what he saw, Jesus was there with a compassionate word and touch. Then Christ goes on to explain why we have no reason to fear: “I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore. Amen.” Jesus died for our sins, was buried, and rose again from the dead on the third day. This is the heart of the Gospel. The reason we have eternal life is because He is alive forevermore. Because He lives, we will live also. We will live for as long as Christ lives. \n\n--“And have the keys of hell and death.” Jesus Christ’s authority over the keys of hell and death was stated back in Matt. 16:18 when He declared that He would build His church, and the gates of hell would not prevail against it. Sometimes, it may seem like the devil is in control and he’s winning, but Jesus holds the keys. \n\n--Revelation is the only book of the Bible that provides its own outline. “The things which thou hast seen” refers to the contents of chapter 1. “The things which are” refers to chapters 2 and 3. “The things which shall be hereafter” refers to chapters 4 through 22. \n\n--Jesus Himself explains some of the symbolism in the vision John saw earlier in the chapter. He explains that the seven stars represent the angels of the seven churches, and the seven golden candlesticks represent the seven churches. Now the Greek word “angel” simply means “messenger,” so it’s not necessarily talking about an actual heavenly angel. Many commentators believe the angels here are the pastors of these seven churches. \n\n--It is important to note the location of these seven stars. They are being held in the hand of Jesus, even the star belonging to the Laodicean church. It is comforting to know that we are being held securely in the hand of Jesus. As John 10:28 says, “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.” \n\n--It is also important to pay attention to where Jesus is. He is standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks, which represent the churches. He is always among His people. Jesus said in Matthew 18:20, “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,” and we see that in action here. We need to remember that, while we may not be able to see Him physically, Jesus Christ is here tonight. He wants to help, encourage, and strengthen His church. He wants to be lifted up and glorified in His church. \n\n--Who is Jesus to you? Is He your Savior? Do you know for sure that your sins are forgiven and you’re on your way to heaven? Is He your Lord? Are you striving to live for Him each day and to be holy because He is holy? Do you need a fresh vision of who Jesus Christ is today? When Jesus is in His rightful place, everything else will fall into its rightful place. ",

    "body": "We've made it to the last chapter in the book of James!  We’ve still got a lot of ground to cover, but we are looking at the finish line here.\n\nLet's go ahead and read chapter 5 verses 1-6 tonight.\n\n> *”1 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. 2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. 3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days. 4 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth. 5 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter. 6 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.”* (Jas 5:1-6 KJV)\n\nWhen I was a kid there was a show on TV called lifestyles of the rich and famous.  It was basically a tour of these ridiculously nice houses.  Some guy with a fifteen car garage full of Porches and Ferraris and a custom built pool.  You probably remember it.\n\nThere are tv shows like that now.  Lots of them.  There are thousands of youtube videos.  Everyone dreams about being rich.  Living the rich and famous lifestyle.\n\nIn the passage we just read James drops a bomb on that.\n\nThis text is a very stark warning to the rich.  Apparently, there were some rich people in this early church and they weren't acting right and James was sending a shot across their bow.  This may be one of the most severe passages in the whole Bible.  \n\nNow, you might say, Pastor, we aren't a rich church.  We are middle class at best.  Some of us are downright poor.  \n\nPaul McCartney is famous for saying that some man’s floor is another man’s ceiling.  We are certainly rich when you look at most of the people in the world.  The average person in India, a country of over a billion people, makes $600 PER YEAR.  Certainly everyone in here is rich to the average indian.\n\nWe need to hear this, because we could all become rich, or we may dream about being rich, or we may seem like we are rich to some other people.\n\nBasically, there are four indictments here agains the rich.  James is playing the part of the prosecutor.  He's being the Trey Gowdy figure here.  And he's got four charges he's bringing against these rich Christians.\n\nLet's look at them, and remember that we can be guilty of all of them too.\n\nThe first charge:\n\n# 1. You've invested in the wrong things.\n\nLook at verses 2 and 3:\n\n> *”2 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten. 3 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.\"*\n\nJames first looks at their riches.  \n\nHe talks about their clothes. Nowadays clothes are almost free.  My guess is that just about everyone here has too many clothes.  We regularly sell clothes for next to nothing at yard sales or give them away to charity.  But that is not the way it used to be.  It used to be that clothes were very, very expensive and very few people had more than a one change of clothes.  Clothes were an investment.\n\nAnd here James says your clothes are motheaten. \n\nThen he talks about their gold and silver.  Gold and silver have always been synonymous with wealth and money.  They are considered to be a safe investment.  But James says there gold and silver is cankered and rusting.  They are decaying before their eyes.\n\nNow, what is James point?  James point is that they are investing in the wrong things.\n\nThis is harkening back to what Jesus said in Mark 6:19-20.  \n\n> *”19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:\"*\n\nWhat are you investing in?\n\nThere is a guy I work for sometimes who runs an investment firm.  He's actually kind of a big deal.  He's written papers in forbes and bloomberg and given conference talks all over the world.  He's one of those guys that they call onto Fox News or CNN to talk about investment and the economy.\n\nI was looking over his blog the other day and he had an article about being a father.  He normally just writes about money stuff, so I wanted to read it.  \n\nNow remember, this guy manages large fortunes for a living.  In the article he talks about one of his clients who passed away and left is two kids 100 million dollars.  That's a LOT of money.   \n\nHe was talking to one of these kids who is about to be a father for the first time and the kid (who just inherited tens of millions) said \"I don't won’t to be like my father.”\n\nMy friend said “Why?  Everyone loved your father? He was larger than life.”\n\nHis son said “I never say that man.  My dad worked 16 hour days, 7 days a week.  He had an office in the basement and he'd come up for dinner and then go back down stairs.  My mom did everything.  Every football practice.  Everything.  I was basically raised by my mom.  I don't want to be like that for my kids.”\n\nHere is a man who invested so much in money.  He amassed a huge fortune.  For what?  My client's point was that maybe he could have had a nest egg of ten million or even less and been there for his kids and he would have been far better off.\n\nAre you investing in the right things?  Are you investing in eternity?  Are you investing in your family?  Are you investing in the church?  Are you investing in the things of God?\n\nI'm not against investing.  I don't think James was either.  But you have to be very careful because where your treasure is there will your heart be also.\n\nSo that's James' first charge. They invested in the wrong things.\n\nThe second charge was...\n\n# 2. They cheated their workers.\nLook at verse 4:\n\n> *”4 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.\"*\n\nThe Old Testament had a command that if you hired a laborer, they had to paid the day when they finished their work.  Laborers were very poor and they needed that money right away.\n\nApparently, these rich folks in the early church were holding back payment from their workers, there was some kind of fraud or lying involved.\n\nI know this doesn't apply to most of us, but if you have people working for you, you have a Christian responsibility to take care of them.  To pay them quickly and fairly.  It's important.\n\nJames said that their cries have reached the lord and he uses a very specific name of the Lord - *“the Lord of sabaoth.”*  That's not the Lord of the sabbath, that’s an old testament Hebrew name that means the Lord of Hosts.  The Lord who is coming back as a conqueror in all his power.\n\nJames is saying you better watch out, if you cheat your workers, the wrath and fury of God the conqueror is going to come after you.\n\nSo they invested in the wrong things.  They cheated their workers.\n\nThe third charge is...\n\n# 3. They lived like an indulgent fatted calf.\n\nVerse 5 says:\n\n> *“Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.”*\n\nThe third charge is that they are living an indulgent, immoral, comfortable lifestyle.  They've pampered themselves.   Fattened themselves up.\n\nIt's actually a word picture here of a fatted calf, who would be kept away from the work and fed and pampered until it was good and fat and then killed for a party or special event.\n\nJames is saying that if you keep treating yourself like the fatted calf you are going to get slain like one.  Bad things are coming.\n\nLet me diverge here and just say, we live in such a pampered, comfortable age. Most of you would flip out if your house was a few degrees off of 69 in the summer or 72 in the winter.  Most of you eat out at restaurants several times a week.  Most of us do very little actual cooking, not compared to people in times past, we buy meals at the grocery store that basically just get heated up.\n\nI was watching the Jetsons a few months ago and Jane Jetson was standing at this giant bank of buttons just pressing a button to make a meal, pressing a button to clean the floor, pressing a button to dust the furniture.  And she turns to George and she says \"This housework is too much, I need a maid.”  We aren't too far off of that.  \n\nImagine if we could take someone from the 1800s and drop them into today.  They wouldn't believe how easy you have it.  Yet we complain and complain. \n\nThere is this scene in the movie Wall-e that I think is one of the most prophetic and condemning things I've ever scene.  They show all the people up in space and they are all living on these \"peoplemovers” where everything they want is taken care of for them by technology.  They can't even walk on their own.\n\n[image:B520C649-1DEA-465C-9310-9A0BB82F0903-4552-0000241DDF17A4D5/Wall-e.png]\n\nListen, it shouldn't be your goal in life to just be comfortable and pleasurable all of the time.  To minimize difficulty and work.  To live in constant pleasure.  Unfortunately, all of us can be guilty of that.  \n\nJames wants us to remember that if you live like a stalled calf - comfortable and kept from all hardship - you might meet the fatted calf’s end - slaughter.\n\nSo 3 charges so far James has brought against these rich men:\n\n* They’ve invested in the wrong things.\n* They’ve cheated their workers.\n* They’ve lived like an indulgent fatted calf.\n\nThere is one more charge James brought against them:\n\n## 4. They were acting like the people who put Jesus on the cross.\n\nLook at verse 6 - James says:\n\n> *”Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.”*\n\nThis is a tricky verse to interpret, because James is speaking to people in the church.  He’s speaking to Christians.  Almost nobody thinks that James is actually accusing these church-members of murder here.  \n\nSo what is James saying?  I think what He’s saying points back to when the Pharisees and Sadducees - all rich men like these guys - were trying Jesus, they knew they were dealing with a just man.  But they let him be railroaded.  They let him be condemned anyway.  \n\nWhy?  It was the path of least resistance.  They didn’t want to ruffle feathers.  They didn’t want to hurt their business.\n\nProbably there were poor believers in their church who were being persecuted by their rich friends, and rather than sticking up for them they were keeping their mouths shut so they didn’t lose their country club memberships.\n\n",

    "body": "We all have to deal with failure from time to time. It’s an inevitable part of life because we are imperfect creatures. Even as Christians, we still have to battle our old sin nature, and sometimes we lose a battle. It shouldn’t be a regular occurrence, but it does happen. So how do we handle failure? Some people just give up and quit. They figure they just can’t handle it, so they don’t even bother trying anymore. I think we can learn a lot about how to react to failure from the life of Abraham here. We often hold up Abraham as one of the giants of the faith, and for good reason. On a few occasions in Scripture, he is called “the friend of God.” Yet even he failed God at times.\n\nIf you read the second half of Genesis 12, you see Abraham struggling in his walk with God. He fails to trust God to provide for him during a famine in Canaan, so he goes down to Egypt. While he’s there, he starts to fear that someone will kill him in order to take his wife Sarah for themselves, so he lies and says she is his sister. This nearly has disastrous consequences when Pharaoh tries to take Sarah as his wife, and God plagued Pharaoh’s house to protect her from being defiled. Naturally, Pharaoh is furious that Abraham lied to him and tells him to get out. Abraham had ruined his testimony and any opportunity to be a witness for the one true God by his actions, and now he’s basically slinking back into Canaan with his tail between his legs after suffering that embarrassing defeat. Now what would he do? That’s what I want us to take a look at here in Genesis 13.\n\n[Read Genesis 13:1-18]\n\nToday, we’re going to be talking about the need sometimes to get back to basics. I’m a huge sports fan. Whenever a team is going through a slump, sometimes you’ll hear commentators or analysts talk about how the team needs to get back to basics so they can snap out of it. In other words, they’re saying the team needs to return their focus on what made them successful in the first place. Sometimes the basics become so routine that you can get into a rut. Everything starts feeling mundane because you’ve done it so many times. You start taking things for granted and letting things slip, and you can start to develop bad habits. You can also develop some bad habits if you never learned to do something properly in the first place.\n\nFor example, I am no good at basketball. I never learned the proper way to shoot or handle the ball, so I’m not an effective player. On the other hand, I’m better at baseball because I played Little League baseball when I was a kid. I learned the fundamentals and basic rules of the sport. When you have a practice, you do the same basic things over and over and over and over again until they almost become second nature. However, the danger is that you get so used to it that sometimes you don’t give your full attention to the play. You take it for granted that you’re going to field that ball, and that’s why sometimes even Gold Glove All-Star baseball players make errors. Then, during the next practice, they dedicate a lot of time to practicing that one thing a million times in order to prevent them from making that same error again.\n\nThe Christian life can get that way, too, sometimes, if we’re not careful. Have you ever read your Bible, only to realize as soon as you close it, that you have no idea what you just read? It happens to me sometimes. If you’ve been saved for a long time, there is always the danger of the Christian life becoming little more than a routine or a habit. We go through the motions simply because that’s what we’re supposed to do. What was once something that felt miraculous can become…mundane. I was saved at the age of 6 at a Vacation Bible School. I can hardly remember a time when I wasn’t a Christian. It’s pretty much what I’ve always known. As such, I have to guard myself against taking my walk with the Lord for granted. \n\nSometimes we fail and backslide as Christians because we start letting things slip a little at a time. “It’s okay if I don’t pray today. It’s just one day.” “It’s not a big deal if I skip church today and go have some fun somewhere else. It’s just one time.” That’s a risky mindset. If you let it go once, what’s to stop you from letting it go a second time, or a third? Big problems almost always begin somewhere as a small oversight or a little bit of neglect. Rarely does a Christian fall into deep sin overnight. It started with something tiny that eventually snowballed into something large. A Christian usually backslides privately long before he backslides publicly.\n\nSo what can we do to recapture that love, that joy, that peace we once seemed to enjoy that gradually feels like it’s fading away? We need to learn from Abraham’s example here in Genesis 13. He had failed miserably during his time in Egypt, but now he was determined to make things right. He did so by getting back to some of the basics of the Christian life. What are some of the “basics” that we see in this chapter?\n\nI. The Basics of Worship (Gen. 13:1-4) – Abraham started by getting back to where he was supposed to be with the Lord first and foremost. That involved returning to the land of Canaan, the land that God had promised to give him and his descendants. Specifically, he returned to the first altar he built between Bethel and Hai (which we saw in 12:8). He returned to the basics of worship by remembering two things, which we also need to remember:\n\nA. He Remembered His Calling (13:1-3) – God had called Abraham to the land of Canaan, not to Egypt. That was where he needed to be, and so that’s where he went. It’s that simple. There are some places as a Christian you know you should not be and things you know you should not do. They may not necessarily be bad things or bad places, until they start taking the Lord’s place in your life. When we get out of the place God has called us to be, no longer doing the thing God has called us to do, that’s when we wind up in trouble. Abraham got out of God’s will and the place of His blessing, and he paid the price for it. We need to learn from Abraham’s example and get back to it. It was a simple step, but a necessary one if he was going to do God’s will. \n\nNowadays, we tend to associate the word “calling” only with preachers, missionaries, or people in “full time ministry,” as they say, but there’s more to it than that. When a person is saved, he receives the Holy Spirit, and he also receives at least one spiritual gift. Some people have more than one, but every Christian has at least one. You can read about that in Romans 12 and I Corinthians 12. \n\nWas there something you used to love to do as a Christian that you don’t seem to enjoy doing anymore? Maybe you used to teach a Sunday School class, but you don’t anymore. Maybe you used to enjoy witnessing on the job, but you’ve given up on that. Maybe you used to enjoy visiting and helping others with their needs, but you got tired of it. Fill in the blank for whatever it may be for you. The Lord did not save us only to sit on a pew a few times per week. He’s got bigger plans for your life than that. Find a way to get involved in what He’s doing and start doing something. As the old saying goes, “Idle hands are the devil’s workshop.” If you don’t make a commitment to doing something for Christ and stick to it, the devil will make sure to find something else to occupy that time. You will make time for the things you want to make time for. It’s as simple as that. There is always something that can be done in God’s work. Find your place and stay in it.\n\nB. He Remembered His First Love (13:4, Rev. 2:4-5) – Abraham went back to the first altar he built, and he called on the name of the Lord there. Sometimes we just need to remember the time when Jesus saved us, and what that was like. Humans are forgetful creatures by nature, and that’s why a lot of the Bible is God saying many of the same things over and over again in different ways. We need to be reminded of things.\n\nRevelation 2:4-5 says, “Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from when thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works…” This was written to the church at Ephesus, and they had the same problem Abraham and many of us have had. They left their first love. What was God’s solution? Remember! Sometimes we just need to make a dedicated effort to remember what Jesus saved us from and what Jesus saved us for. One of the ways we “remember” is by getting back to the basics of where our Christian life started, when everything was still new and exciting to us. \n\nHave you taken the time lately to think about just how much Jesus loves you? My life verses are II Corinthians 5:14-15: “For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we this judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.” What should compel us to live for Christ? The fact that He loved us so much He died for us. Remember why you fell in love with Him in the first place. \n\nThis is true of any relationship. Sometimes relationships can grow cold, and the way to get them back to the way they were is to remember what made it such a good relationship in the first place. You have to get back to the basics of a good relationship, including love. We have to remember that love is more than just a tingly feeling. That eventually goes away, but love is more of a commitment than a feeling. Remember why you love God, and get back to the basics, those “first works.”\n\nII. The Basics of Walking (Gen. 13:5-18) – Abraham has gotten back into the promised land and back to that first altar, but now a new problem arises. After spending some time in Egypt, Abraham and Lot had become very well off, and that led to some conflicts between them. As the old saying goes, “Mo’ money, mo’ problems.” The way Abraham handled this problem provides an example for us when it comes to dealing with problems. A large part of the Christian life is how we react when we face trouble. Abraham’s solution was rooted in very basic Christianity, and yet many of us neglect these things in our own Christian walk.\n\nA. He was aware of his testimony (13:5-7) – The Bible takes the time to point out that the Canaanite and the Perizzite were living in the land at that time as well. Abraham had blown his opportunity to be a good witness in Egypt, and he was not about to ruin his testimony again. Many times as Christians, we forget this one very basic fact: Lost people are watching us. If you claim to be a Christian, lost people will pay attention to what you say and do. The way you handle conflict, especially with other Christians, will have a lot to do with how effective your testimony is. \n\nAnother thing we often forget: Your life is supposed to be seen. Matthew 5:14-16 says, “Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.” The lost world needs to see something in you that they don’t have. That’s why it is important for Christians to be different, and that’s why it is a mistake for churches to try to act like the world to accommodate lost people. The world does not need another cheap imitation of itself. People can get that anywhere, but where are they supposed to hear the truth? To somebody, you’re the best Christian they know, so the least you can do is be a good one.\n\nI’ve heard many people use the excuse that it doesn’t matter how they live because God looks on the heart. While it is true that God looks on the heart, the first part of the verse they’re referencing says that man looks on the outward appearance. The Lord can see your heart, but other people can’t. They can only see how you live. Philippians 2:14-15 says, “Do all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world.”  \n\nThere are many things I don’t say or do, not necessarily because I believe they’re wrong, but because of my testimony. Paul told the Thessalonians to avoid even the appearance of evil. I don’t want to be seen doing something that could be misconstrued as sinful because I was careless. It doesn’t matter if what I was doing was actually what they thought I was doing. People will jump to their own conclusions, whether that’s fair or not, so don’t give them bad conclusions to jump to. People will usually fill in the blanks for themselves, whether it’s right or not. That’s my personal philosophy anyway.\n\nB. He attempted to make peace with humility (13:8-13) – Those two things are very important to note here. Abraham took the initiative in trying to solve the problem. The more spiritual person will usually make the first move. One of the Beatitudes in Matthew 5 is, “Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.” We are not called simply to be peacekeepers, but peacemakers. There is a difference. \n\nAbraham begins by reminding Lot of their relationship. There was no need for all this bickering and fighting. After all, they were family. We will not always get along with other Christians. There are times when we have disagreements and arguments, but at the end of the day, we ought to be able to resolve them because we’re family. We have to be careful about letting problems from within destroy the church. That will begin when one person has enough humility to take the first step and actively try to make peace as Abraham did here.\n\nOne of my personal pet peeves is the phrase, “Get over it.” Whenever two people have a problem, you will usually hear one or both of them say that the other person should just “get over it.” They’re trying to shift all the blame and responsibility to the other person. Now, while it’s quite likely that there’s something the other person should get over, it’s a two-way street. \n\nThis even applies to things we don’t think are wrong. Read Romans 12-14 and I Corinthians 8 sometime. They are powerful passages on how Christians ought to deal with problems with each other. In these passages, Paul essentially says that the stronger Christian should defer to the weaker Christian in matters of personal preference and opinion to avoid offense. Paul even went so far as to say that he would not even eat meat if it would cause another brother to be offended by it. It was not because Paul was a vegan and thought eating meat was wrong. There is no Biblical basis for saying eating meat is wrong. It’s just a matter of preference. What Paul was saying that his relationship with his brethren was more important than his personal preferences. In his humility, he was willing to restrict himself for the sake of other Christians. \n\nIf many of us were in Paul’s place, we’d grab a big chunk of meat, get up in their faces, and start eating it right in front of them. You ever know anyone like that, who knows something annoys you, so they do it on purpose just to annoy you even more? If you’re that guy, I just want to go ahead and tell you: Nobody likes that guy. However, because Paul was the stronger Christian, he made the first move to reconcile, and he placed restrictions on his own liberty in the process.\n\nAbraham does the same thing with Lot here. God promised the land to Abraham, not to Lot. Abraham was Lot’s senior and essentially his adoptive father. He had every right to tell Lot to get over it or get out. Instead, Abraham provides a peaceful solution and lets Lot have the first choice. As we’ll see later on, Lot chose poorly, but as the stronger believer, Abraham humbly deferred to his nephew here. Humility is one of the crowning virtues of Christianity, one that sets it apart from nearly every other belief system out there. You can find many passages in the New Testament that talk about the meekness and humility of Christ, and yet many of us struggle to exhibit it ourselves. Let’s be like Abraham and seek to be peacemakers and act with humility.\n\nC. He trusted God with the outcome (13:14-18) – Abraham’s mistake in Genesis 12 was that he did not trust God. He did not trust God to provide for his family during the famine in Canaan, so he went to Egypt. He did not trust God to keep him and Sarah safe, so he lied. Now it appears that Abraham has learned his lesson. He allowed Lot to choose wherever he wanted to go and settle in the promised land, and he would go elsewhere. \n\nAfter Lot separated from him, God spoke to Abraham and told him to look in every direction. As far as his eye could see, that land would be his. If we assume Abraham was still around Bethel and Hai, in terms of Bible geography, the land is elevated and there are some mountains in that area. Perhaps Abraham was standing on top of one of those mountains, where he could see the land of Canaan for miles all around. \n\nAbraham trusted that the Lord would not forget His promises to him, so it was no problem for him to let Lot have the first choice. Many times, we want to take matters into our own hands because we’re afraid things won’t turn out well for us if we don’t. However, as Jim Elliot once said, “God always gives His best to those who leave the choice with Him.” Abraham is certainly proof of that. \n\nI hope this message has been an encouragement to you. If you’ve found yourself struggling in your Christian life lately, I hope you’ll try getting back to basics like Abraham did. Sometimes, that’s all we need.",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me again and turn to Galatians 5.  We basically wrapped this chapter up last week, but we have one verse that is going to lead us right into chapter 6.\n\nBefore we even look at it, I want you to read one verse in Galatians 5 with me that really seems out of place.  Look at verse 15:\n\n> *”But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.”*\n\nRight here, in the middle of talking about walking in the Spirit and living with the fruit of the Spirit, the Apostle Paul warns us about what can happen when Christians don’t follow the Spirit - they can bite and devour one another.\n\nMy kids have gotten into a pretty good stage.  They play together pretty well most of the time.  But every now and then, Noah will really want something that the girls are playing with, and he’s start screaming at them, and then Molly will chase Noah around the house, and inevitably, if we don’t step in, someone will end up getting either hit or bit.  And it’s always something silly.  Like a lego set or a TV channel.\n\nThat’s childish.  It’s silly.  It’s sad.  And here Paul is warning us that churches can act like a bunch of squabbling children.  They bite and devour one another.  They consume each other.  It’s ugly.\n\nI heard an old preacher say “To dwell above with saints I love, O that will be glory.  To dwell below with saints I know, now that is another story.”  \n\nSometimes churches can get ugly.  Christians can squabble with each other.\n\nNow I read all of that, because the verses we are reading this morning are kind of a continuation of that thought.  It’s like Paul started talking about problems in church, took a break to talk about the fruit of the spirit and the works of the flesh, and went right back to church problems again.\n\nLet’s read Galatians 5:25-6:5\n\n> *”[Gal 5:25-26 KJV] 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.”*\n\n> *”[Gal 6:1-5 KJV] 1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. 3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 5 For every man shall bear his own burden.”*\n\nNotice something, Paul goes right from walking in the Spirit in verse 25 to fighting and squabbling with your fellow believers in verse 26.  And I think the reason he does that is because one of the hardest places to actually walk in the Spirit and show the fruit of the Spirit is in your relationships with other people.\n\nNow, before I go any further, let me just say something that the scripture assumes, that isn’t very obvious to modern church going people: **The New Testament assumes that you are going to have a very active relationship with your church family.** A lot of modern church goers think of going to church almost like going to the movies, it’s just a place you go.  But that’s completely absent from the New Testament.  \n\nIn the New Testament, there are tons of what we call the “one another” passages.  They are passages about how you relate to your church family.  And they make absolutely no sense if the only time you see your church family is on Sunday Morning once a month.  \n\nThis assumes you’ll be together a lot, that you will “do life” together, that you will be more of a family than just a club.\n\nSo how are we supposed to act, in the spirit, to our fellow church members.  \n\nJust to help you remember, I’ve taken these verses and made three “be this - not that” statements.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll get into it…**\n\nLook again at the last verse in chapter 5:\n\n> *”26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.”*\n\nNow, look at verse 2 of chapter 6 (we’ll get to verse 1 in a minute)\n\n> *”Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.”*\n\nThe first thing I want you to see from these verses is that if we are walking in the Spirit we should…\n\n# 1. Be a servant, not a star.\n\nVerse 26 starts by saying “Let us not be desirous of vain glory.”  What does that mean?  Vain glory is applause, it’s popularity, it’s position.  It’s desiring to be at the top, to be recognized.  And it’s something that we are commanded not to want.\n\nYou shouldn’t want to be the star of the church.  It’s not a place to shine.  It’s not a place to stand out.  \n\nI’ve got to tell you, I fell into this trap when I was younger.  When I went to church, I got dressed to the nines because I was putting on a show.  I took every opportunity to sing or lead or preach that I could, not out of a desire to minister, but out of a desire to shine.  I loved to hear how good I was.\n\nVain glory.\n\nAnd when you are chasing vain glory, do you know what happens?  You roll over other people.  You get in competition with each other.  You provoke.\n\nDo you know what that word means?  It means “to challenge to a combat or contest.”  Church becomes a competition - can I be a better singer than that guy.  Can I be a better teacher than that guy?  Can I dress better than those people.\n\nNot only do you compete with others you envy each other.  You look at other people and think “Why do they get to get so much recognition?  I’m better than that preacher.  I’m a better singer than that person.  Why do they get the limelight.”\n\nChurch - this kind of mentality is so subtle and it’s so, so wicked.  Hold your finger here and turn with me to James 3.\n\nJames 3:13-14\n\n> *”Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.”*\n\nThis is talking about teachers here, people that actually have spiritual wisdom to teach.  And notice what it says, it says that if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not.\n\nThis is a direct parallel to what we just read in Galatians.  Envying is wanting what someone else has.  Strife is a competitive mindset.\n\nLook at the next two verses:\n\n> *”This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.”*\n\nDo you want to really mess up a church?  Fill it with people who want glory, who can’t stand to see others do well, and who have a competitive mindset in church.  It will tear the church apart.  The church will become a circus.  It’s a bad deal.\n\nWe don’t need stars in church.  That’s not what church is about.  We don’t need more talent.  We need more Christlikeness.  We don’t need more amazing preachers, we need more Spirit-led preachers.  We don’t need more knock the house down soloists, we need humble ministers of Christ.\n\nDon’t be a star, be a servant.  Don’t be desirous of vain glory, don’t be competitive, don’t be envious - instead do the total opposite of that, bear each other’s burdens.\n\nYou see this in the disciples.  In the gospels, the disciples were constantly jockeying with each other for position.  Two of the disciples even had their mom go to Jesus and ask him to have her two sons be on his right hand and left hand in the Kingdom.  \n\nAnd what did Jesus do? He said \n\n> *”But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;  And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:”* (Matthew 20:26-27)\n\nIn another passage Jesus took a towel and He got down on the ground and he washed his disciples feet.  Why?  Because He wanted to teach us that it’s not about being a star, it’s about being a servant.\n\nSo how about you?  Do you have a “star” mentality or a “servant” mentality?  \n\nBe a servant, not a star.\n\nThe second “be this, not that” statement I want you to see in the Scripture this morning is…\n\n# 2. Be a cautious restorer, not a contentious rebuker.\n\nLook at Galatians 6:1 again\n\n> *”Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”*\n\nNow this is totally foreign to modern church goers.  I mean this verse seems like it comes out of left field.  \n\nWhat this verse is telling us to do is to meekly, and carefully help our brothers and sisters in Christ who are struggling with sin, and try to restore them to fellowship and service.\n\nBut it’s telling us to be careful, because there is a great danger here.  Whenever you are talking about other people’s sin and other people’s failures there are a couple of dangers:\n\n### First, you can become self-righteous, and have the wrong end.\n\nNotice the word “restore” in this verse.  It’s an important word.  One of the temptations that we can have when it comes to dealing with other people’s sins is we can want to just get rid of them. We can think, we don’t want that kind of sinner around here.  They’ve blown it.  They are off the team.\n\nThat is never to be the spirit of dealing with sin.  \n\nThe New Testament lays out this process that we call church discipline for confronting sin.  If someone is in sin, you go to them privately, if they don’t here you, you bring someone else, if they still won’t hear you, you bring them before the church.  The church can also put people out, we see an example of that in the book of 1 Corinthians where Paul commanded the church to put out the person who was having an incestous relationship with his stepmother.\n\nBut the goal is never to get rid of people, the goal is to restore people.  The goal is to bring about repentance.  Even in the case of the man in that wicked relationship in 1 Corinthians, Paul told the church in 2 Corinthians to go bring him back.  It was about repentance and restoration.\n\nListen folks, we all have the same disease.  It’s called sin.  I’ve got it. You’ve got it.  It might manifest itself in different ways. But each of us have it.    We’ve found the cure in Jesus, but we all have been bitten by the same serpent.\n\nIt’s not for us to look down on other sinners.  That’s not what this is about.  It’s about helping people who are struggling.  We have to remember that.\n\nWe sang the song “o church arise” this morning.  I love the second verse:\n\n> Our call to war, to love the captive soul, but to rage against the captor, and with the sword that makes the wounded whole, we will fight with faith and valor.\n\nWe have to remember we aren’t warring against people - we are warring against their captor - sin and the devil.  And our goal isn’t to destroy people it’s to destroy sin and save people.\n\nA second danger in dealing with other people’s sin is…\n\n### Second, you can be harsh, and hurt the person.\n\nIt says *ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;*. Remember, meekness means gentleness.\n\nYou don’t go in with guns blazing - “You dirty sinner, you vile serpent, you wicked rat.”  It’s not like that.  You approach people in meekness and gentleness.\n\nYou don’t cut sin out with an axe, you cut sin out with a scalpel.  You try to do as little damage as possible and you let people know you are just trying to help them.\n\nListen folks, there is a trap here.  It appeals to the pride of some people to pick out other people’s sin and that’s not what God intended.  God intended this be done in humility and meekness.\n\nA third danger is…\n\n### Third, you can be tempted yourself.\n\nIt says:\n\n> *”considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.”*\n\nThe truth is, it’s much, much easier for someone to pull you down than it is for you to pull them up.  \n\nEveryone thinks they are strong enough, everyone thinks they are doing this for good reasons, but it’s quite possible, it’s actually probable that someone we are trying to help might pull us down to their level.\n\nLet me tell you something, this is just general life advice, surround yourself with people that are better than you, that are higher than you, that are holier than you.  Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you can befriend people living in open sin and that you are going to save them.  There is a big possibility that they will pull you down, not the other way around.\n\nSo, be a cautious restorer.  Be very careful about it, don’t be a contentious rebuker.\n\nOne more “be this - not that” statement here:\n\n# 3. Be big on self-examination, not big on other-examination.\n\nLook at verses 3-5:\n\n> *”[Gal 6:3-5 KJV] 3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself. 4 But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another. 5 For every man shall bear his own burden.”* \n\nThe problem that Paul is addressing here in these verses is pride.  This is one thing that keeps us from being a servant, from helping others, we think we are too good, too big, too important.  We think we don’t have any problems.\n\nWe should be our own biggest critics.  Rather than looking at the specks in everyone else eyes, we should take care of the two-by-fours sticking out of our own eyes.\n\nVerse 4 says *”Let every man prove his own work.”* The word “prove” there means “test” or “examine.”  \n\nWhat this is saying is look at yourself under a microscope before you look at others because some day, we are each going to stand before God and answer to Him, and He sees everything.\n\nThe idea here is this, you don’t look at other Christians and say “Wow, look at what that guy is doing, he’s a carnal goat, I’m way more spiritual than he is.”  That’s not how we examine our works.\n\nNo, we look at ourself.  We look at our sin.  A better way is to say “Wow, man that guy is struggling over there, and I’m struggling with this here.  Maybe God can help me with this sin in my life and then I can help Him.”  \n\n\n\n",

    "body": "We had a great week at revival didn’t we? I tell you - if you missed it, you missed it. It was awesome. We saw God answer some prayers. We saw people get their heart right and get victory over some things in their life. It was awesome.\n\nAnd do you what else was awesome about it? Brother Flanders is a smart guy. I caught him reading his greek new testament this week - now, I took a couple of years of greek but I have never taken out my greek new testament to read it and neither have probably 99% of the people I went to school with. He’s a smart guy. He can talk inteligently about just about any issue and he knows his bible - but do you know what you could say about all of the preaching?\n\nIt was simple. It was just basic stuff.\n\nHow to pray.\nHow to think about lost family.\nHow to be a witness.\nSimple stuff. Straight from the Bible, not watered down, but simple.\n\nWe were actually planning on being away this Sunday. We usually miss one Sunday in February and go and visit my wife’s family in Georgia. We were going to do it today but so many good things happened last week I just wanted to be here today so we put off the whole trip a week.\n\nAnd I’ve felt led to preach a couple of messages, this morning and tonight, on the very basics. This is Christianity 101.\n\nThis morning I want to talk to you about Conversion, or what we Christians often call “getting saved” and to do it I want us to go to the most famous passage in the entire Bible. We are going to read John 3 this morning, verses 1-19.\n\nLet’s read that text and then pray:\n\n”There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God:for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth:so is every one that is born of the Spirit. Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness. If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven. 14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. 18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.”\n\nWhat do we Christians mean when we talk about “getting saved?” Or when we talk about “conversion.” It is absolutely the most important teaching in the whole Bible - it is the difference between heaven and hell - and yet a lot of people who go to church don’t really know this basic thing.\n\nThis is a good story to go to for answers because in this story, maybe more than in any other, Jesus himself tells us about what it means to get saved.\n\nSo what happens in this story?\n\nVerse 1 says\n\n”There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews: the same came to Jesus by night.”\n\nThere are two characters in this story: Nicodemus and Jesus. Let’s talk about those characters for a second.\n\nWe only get 14 words describing Nicodemus. Just one short sentence. But that one short sentence tells us a ton about him.\n\nWe know his gender. He was a man.\nWe know his name. Nicodemus.\nWe know his political affiliation. He was a pharisee.\nWe know his status. He was a ruler.\nWe know his ethnicity. He was a jew.\nThat’s just what the passage says on its face. If you know a little bit about the history of the Bible, these fourteen words tell us a lot more.\n\nWe know his morality. Because he was a respected Pharisee, he lived by a very strict moral code. He was, at least to the eyes of others, morally impeccable.\nWe know his feelings toward religion. That’s another thing we can figure out because of his status as a ruler of the Pharisees. This man was extremely devout. He knew his Bible front to back. He was a constant synagogue attender. He was religious guy.\nWe can guess at his net worth. People weren’t generally elected to be rulers of the jews unless they had some money in the bank. Nicodemous would have been a pretty wealthy guy.\nSo that’s Nicodemous.\n\nOf course the second participant in this conversation is Jesus. This is pretty early in Jesus ministry at this point, but He’s still an extremely in-demand teacher and preacher. He is a man who is working miracles all over the place. He is a man with a sparkling repuation. His teachings are spreading around palestine.\n\nSo, Nicodemous hears about Jesus, and decides to pay Jesus a visit, he wants to have a conversation. He comes to Jesus at night and he comes praising Jesus.\n\nVerse 2 says he came saying to Jesus “Rabbi” - remember, that’s just an old fashioned title for “teacher”. Master or teacher, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no man can do the miracles which thou doest, unless God be with him.\n\nDo you know what that sounds like? It sounds like Nicodemus is buttering Jesus up. Kind of like when my kids come to me and say “Daddy, your the best daddy in the whole world.” and before they can say another word I’m thinking “Ok, kid, what do you want.”\n\nWe don’t get to know what Nicodemus wanted. Jesus cut off that part of the conversation. He had much more interesting things to talk about.\n\nJesus looked at Nicodemus and said\n\n”Verily, verily, I say unto thee,”\n\nThat means “truly, truly” Jesus is saying amen to his own sermon before He even talks here.\n\n”Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”\n\nHere is what Jesus wanted to talk about. He wanted to talk about conversion, that’s what “born again” means. Conversion. He wanted to talk about getting saved. Specifically, He wanted to talk about how Nicodemus’ needed to get saved.\n\nSo let’s take the rest of the message this morning and break down what Jesus said to Nicodemus about conversion. I’ll give you four main points this morning. The first thing I want us to look at is…\n\n1. The need for conversion.\nJesus said to Nicodemus except a man be born of again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Jesus was saying to Nicodemus, nobody is going to see that unless they’ve been “born again.”\n\nNow, when we hear the term “Born again” we think immediately about “getting saved” or “being converted” but when Jesus said it to Nicodemus, it probably hit him like a Mac truck. Born again!?\n\nSo Nicodemus asks “How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?”\n\nAnd Jesus has an answer:\n\n”Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.”\n\nIt’s like Jesus was saying: look Nicodemus, we are talking about something spiritual here. Not a second physical birth, but birth by the Spirit.\n\nAnd notice, he finishes his statement with: “Ye must be born again”\n\nYe - Nicodemus - Ye must be born agian.\n\nNow, I want to stop here and sort of pull back, because this tells us a lot about the need for conversion. I mean, if it was a roman that came to Jesus, we wouldn’t think very much about Jesus saying “ye must be born again.” If it was the lady we’ll see in John 4, we’d expect Jesus to say that.\n\nBut Nicodemus?\n\nYou probably would be hard pressed to find a more moral, upstanding, religious guy than Nicodemus. He was a jew. More than that, he was a Pharisee. Yet Jesus says “ye must be born again.”\n\nSo what does that tell us about our own need for conversion? It tells us this:\n\nReligion doesn’t make up for the need for conversion. Nobody can skip conversion because they are in a church house.\nMorality doesn’t make up for the need for conversion. It doesn’t matter how morally upstanding you are. You must be born again.\nFamily heritage doesn’t make up for the need for conversion. It wasn’t enough to be a jew. It’s not enough to be a part of a Christian home.\nIf ever there was a guy who should have been able to skip being “born again” it was Nicodemus. He seemed to be doing pretty well the first time. But Jesus said “Ye must be born again.”\n\nSo what does this mean for us?\n\nLet me tell you - ye must be born again. You aren’t going to get into heaven, you aren’t going to see the kingdom of God, because of your parents. You aren’t going to get to heaven because you are sitting in church. You aren’t going to get into heaven because of your good deeds. You must be born again.\n\nReligion doesn’t save people. Church attendance doesn’t do it. Morality doesn’t do it. Being well off and upstanding won’t cut it. Getting dunked in a baptistry won’t do it. Ye must be born again:\n\nI have a friend who pastors in Ohio who went to Bible college, served as a pastor like ten years and was well looked up to - but he had never been saved!\n\nI don’t care who you are. I don’t care what you’ve done. I don’t care how many church services you’ve sat through. If you’ve never had a true conversion experience, if you have never been saved, heaven will not be your eternal home.\n\nYe must be born again.\n\nSome day you will stand before a Holy God and have to give an answer - and your morality, your righteousness - God says He views them as filthy rags. The term in the greek language is even more instructive - I’m not going into details but God chose the most disgusting word picture He possibly could to describe our own righteousness. You aren’t getting into heaven on that.\n\nYou must be born again. You must get saved. That’s the need for conversion.\n\nAnother thing we can learn in this conversation is…\n\n2. The nature of conversion.\nIn other words, what is conversion like?\n\nJesus said three things to Nicodemus that tell us exactly what being born again, or being converted, is like.\n\nA. First, conversion is spiritual.\nNicodemus was thinking of it on purely physcial terms, but Jesus wanted to make it clear that it was a spiritual new birth.\n\nJesus said ”Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” When a person is born, they have a spirit, but it is dead. When they are converted or born again, they become spiritually alive.\n\nI grew up in church. I started singing in the church choir when I was ten. I was the annoying kid in children’s church that new the answer to every question and won all of the Bible memory games. But I was spiritually dead. The preaching, most of the teaching, it made no sense to me and I had no desire for it. I never prayed unless other people were watching. My mind was overrun with wickedness and selfishness. There was absolutely nothing spiritual going on inside me.\n\nBut when I was born again, I had a sudden hunger to pray. Praying became natural. I had a desire and a hunger for the Bible. I actually wanted to hear preaching. To be with God’s people. It was like a spiritual light bulb went on all of a sudden, and I became alive spiritually.\n\nSo being born again is spiritual.\n\nB. Second, conversion is radical.\nJesus picked the metaphor “born again,” new birth. That’s a pretty radical metaphor. He didn’t pick a metaphor of evolution, something that happens over a long period of time. He didn’t say you must “grow again” like a plant, or be “built again” like a building. Those are gradual things. No, He said “be born again”\n\nBirth happens in an instant, and it creates something brand new. So it is with conversion. It’s instantaneous and radical.\n\nConversion can turn a godless, hard living, gang leader like my father-in-law into a mild, church loving, clean living, Bible-believing Christian.\n\nConversion can turn selfish, sharp tongued politicians like William Wilburforce and Charles Colson into mild men devoted to helping others.\n\nConversion can take a bitter, alcoholic POW like Louis Zamperini and give him the grace to cry over and forgive the men who beat him daily for years.\n\nOne of the godliest and kindest pastors I ever knew was Roy Thompson, the late pastor of the Cleveland Baptist Temple in Cleveland, OH. God used that man greatly in a lot of people’s lives all over the world. He had a humble sweetness about him that was evident.\n\nBut the first time Roy Thompson went to church - he was literally an alcoholic bum. He was homeless. He only went with his sister because he thought she might give him a meal and maybe some money for booze.\n\nBut God got ahold of him - and God changed him!\n\nAnd you may not have so radical a conversion story, but I guarantee you if you’ve been born again, it was radical in some sense. The Holy Spirit came to live in you. That’s radical. Maybe Jesus was alluding to the book of Ezekiel here, where the wind blew into a valley full of dead man’s bones and they started walking.\n\nThat’s what conversion is like, it’s like the wind blowing into the skeleton of our life and making us really alive for the first time.\n\nHave you been saved? Have you been born again?\n\nIt would be absolutely terrible if you came to this church week after week, month after month, year after year and you heard Bible teaching and preaching and you never were saved!\n\nYe must be born again!\n\nOne more thing about the nature of conversion in this conversation…\n\nC. Third, conversion is mysterious.\nJesus compared conversion to the wind.\n\nNow, in both greek and in hebrew, the word for spirit and the word for wind were interchangeable. So this was a natural illustration here.\n\nJesus said “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth:so is every one that is born of the Spirit.”\n\nWe can hear the wind, we can feel the wind, but we have no idea where it’s coming from or where it’s going or why it’s doing what it’s doing. Nicodemus, conversion is like that.\n\nThere is something mysterious about how conversion works. I mean, it’s not something easy to scientifically observe. It’s not a process that we can easily understand. It’s mysterious, but just like the wind, we know it when we feel it, we know it when we hear it.\n\nBeing born again is a radical, mysterious spiritual change that happens in a person.\n\nThey become spiritually alive.\n\n2 Corinthians 5:17 describes conversion this way\n\n””Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\n\nThey are assured a place in heaven\n\nWhen a person is converted, they get to be a part of the kingdom of God. They get more than just new life, they get everlasting life.\n\nAll of this begs the question “If being born again is so awesome, and if it’s absolutely necessary to get to heaven, how in the world does a person become born again?”\n\nLet’s look at that with…\n\n3. The getting of conversion.\nJesus actually answers this in the rest of the conversation. But I’m going to save that for next Sunday.\n\nLook at the end of John 3. Look at verses 14-15\n\nAnd as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: 15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\n\nJesus said to Nicodemus - He said “You know that story in the Old Testament, where everyone got bit by these snakes, and they were all dying, and the only way that they could live was by looking at a bronze serpent on a pole?”\n\nNicodemus - Yes\n\nJesus said - That’s what getting saved is like. The son of man (Me) is going to be lifted up (on the cross) and whoever believes in me will not perish.\n\nThen Jesus gave us the most famous verse in the Bible - John 3:16\n\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\nDo you want to be born again? You have to believe on Jesus!\n\nWell, how do you do that? Let me close with an illustration.\n\nAbout seven years ago, I was working as a Christian school teacher. We had recently had our first child, so my wife wasn’t working. We were struggling to get by on my salary alone. The Lord sent us a lot of blessings though, and we made it through that period with more than enough.\n\nAround Christmas time one year, a wealthy man in our church gave each teacher a Christmas card. Inside the Christmas card was a plain Applebee’s business card along with a note that said:\n\n“Take this business card to Applebee’s for a free meal for your family.”\n\nI picked up the business card and looked it over. Nothing on the business card said anything about a free meal. It was just a plain-looking business card from one of the Applebee’s managers with an illegible signature on the back. I remember thinking, “I don’t know about this.”\n\nhttps://lh6.googleusercontent.com/eQ0NxpwS6CjFSGco5vmMsGF2a-dI0ABe7FJ3DvGJDbWXPOVFqO--k0lN8x8QgLatEl3FvSrsi8mSip0OXiwj3jnL1YiphNlcxggnD4Q04qPhWoiwgmSGaefwNE_icNUNdIlAY2S7DsMZLw\n\nBut we decided to go anyway. As we ordered our meals (the quesadilla burger is awesome, by the way), I remember thinking, “I sure hope this works, because I don’t know how we are going to pay for this if it doesn’t.”\n\nWe ate our meal, and when the waitress brought the bill, I took out that business card and slipped it into the black bill folder. Then I sheepishly told the waitress that I was told to give them this. She gave me a perplexed look and then took the bill and business card to wherever employees talk to their managers. After an awkward few minutes, the manager came to our table, introduced himself, told us there would be no charge for our meal, and asked us if we wanted dessert. Needless to say, I was relieved.\n\nI remember that little episode often, because I think it’s a great illustration of saving faith. We have been amassing a bill. Through our many sins, we have been building up a “judgment bill” with a holy God. Like my wife and me eating in that restaurant, it’s a bill we cannot pay. When we die, we are going to have to face God and be judged for our sins.\n\nAnd as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27) Unfortunately, the Bible makes it clear that that judgment is eternal death—separation from God—and judgment in the lake of fire.\n\nThe good news is we have a wealthy Friend who has paid our bill for us! The Bible says in Romans 6:23:\n\nFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\nJohn 3:16 says:\n\nFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\n\nGod loved us so much that He sent His Son Jesus to pay our sin bill for us. Your bill has been paid!\n\nHowever, much like I had to have enough trust in my wealthy friend to believe that business card would cover my order, we need to have enough trust in God to believe that what Jesus did on the cross nearly 2,000 years ago pays our bill with our heavenly Father. We need to believe on Jesus through faith. This is the only way we are going to pay our sin bill.\n\nFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)\n\nWhen Christians talk about “getting saved,” this is what we are talking about: the act of realizing we are sinners with a debt to God we cannot pay, and the act of putting our faith in what Jesus did for us on the cross so long ago.\n\nSo I want to close by asking one more time: Have you been born again? Have you been saved? Have you been “converted?” Have you trusted what Jesus did on the cross for your sins.\n\nAre you trying to pay your own bill? You don’t have it. You are going to come up short - you have to trust what Jesus did on the cross for you.\n\nI did that as a fourteen year old boy, I finally came to the point where I was sick of being a hypocrite, sick of living in my sins, and I asked Jesus to save me. I was converted! I was born again! I got saved!\n\nHave you ever done that?",

    "body": "# The Faith of Four Friends\nWhat does it mean to be a good friend?\n\nProverbs 18:24 says:\n\n> *”A man [that hath] friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend [that] sticketh closer than a brother.”*\n\nOne of the greatest blessings of life is good friends; friends that will pick you up when you are down; friends that will cheer you up when you are sad; friends that you can just share life with; friends that you can go back and forth with and learn from.\n\nFriends can do a lot of good for you, **but the greatest thing a friend can do is bring you to Jesus**.  If you have the kind of friends who pray for you, the kind of friends who share the gospel with you, or the kind of friends who point you to Jesus, then you have real friends and you are blessed.\n\nI’ve got a couple really good friends.  Some of my best friends are missionaries.  Here is kind of a little secret for you: One ulterior motive to having missionaries come in and present to you is the fellowship.  They encourage me and my family.\n\nMy stepdad and my brothers are some of my best friends, and I talk to them almost every day.  They encourage me.  They challenge me.  They call me out if I’m being silly.  They sharpen my thinking.\n\nI hope you have good, godly friends.  I truly believe that who you choose to be your close friends has a bigger impact on your life than almost anything.\n\n> *”He that walketh with wise men shall be wise, but a companion of fools will be destroyed.”* (Proverbs 13:20)\n\nListen: If you get nothing out of this message today besides a challenge to pick great, wise, godly friends, it will still change your life for the better.\n\nIn our passage today, we are going to look at one of the greatest stories of faith and friendship we see anywhere in the Bible.  It’s a very familiar story. It’s probably one of the stories you remember from Sunday School as a kid, and it’s still a great one and has some lessons for us today.  \n\nLet’s read our text, Mark 2:1-12\n\n> *”Mark 2:1-12 (KJV) 1 And again he entered into Capernaum after [some] days; and it was noised that he was in the house. 2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive [them], no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word unto them. 3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four. 4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken [it] up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. 6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, 7 Why doth this [man] thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only? 8 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? 9 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, [Thy] sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk? 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,) 11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house. 12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.”*\n\nThe main thrust of Mark 2 is actually opposition.  This chapter is setting up the bad guys in the story (the Pharisees) with a bunch of little pictures where we see the Pharisees’ bad attitude and opposition to Jesus, but we are actually going to spend about a month covering that and I’m excited about it.  But that’s for next week.\n\nWhat I want to do this morning is to consider the amazing faith and friendship of these four friends.\n\nJesus is preaching in Capernaum, which has kind of become his home base.  He’s in a house—maybe Simon Peter’s house—and people get wind that He’s there, so they just start filling up the house to see Jesus. History tells us that the Jews in Palestine had a very open culture.  It wasn’t a locked door kind of place.  You’d just leave your front door open, and anyone could come into your house and visit.  \n\nWell, *everyone* came into this house. It becomes this great crowd.  The house is just slammed, and Jesus is preaching to them.\n\nVerse 3 says:\n\n> *”3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.”*\n\nLet me explain what is going on here.  “Palsy” refers to paralysis.  This man is bedridden and paralyzed.  We don’t know why. Some kind of mystery sickness has left him unable to move his legs.  \n\nFive years ago, we had Jimmy and Alicia Reagan with us.  Alicia was fairly healthy, but she got sick while she was expecting a baby and for some mysterious reason, she woke up paralyzed from the waist down.  That’s been ten years ago.  She’ll likely never walk again.  God has greatly used the Reagans to minister to handicapped people and to encourage lots of other people going through adversity.\n\nThat’s probably what this man went through.  For whatever reason, something happened, and he couldn’t walk any more.  He was paralyzed and completely unable to take care of himself.  \n\nAll of a sudden, there was a lot this man didn’t have:  He didn’t have the ability to take care of himself.  He didn’t have the ability to go out on the fishing boats and make a living for his family.  He didn’t have the ability to walk to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  He didn’t have legs that could stretch and take him out for a stroll in the countryside.\n\nBut for all he didn’t have, he did have four awesome friends.  These four guys knew he needed help, and they knew that the best chance—the only chance—he had was to see Jesus, and they were determined to bring him to Jesus, no matter what.\n\nI want to give you four points this morning about the faith of these four friends.  I think they are a great example of what it sometimes takes to bring people to Jesus.  \n\n**Let’s pray and I’ll give you those four points.**\n\nWhat kind of faith did these four friends have to have to bring their friend to Jesus?\n\nFirst,\n\n## 1. These four friends had a loving, compassionate faith.\n\nWe don’t know how they knew the man sick of the palsy.  Maybe they were cousins.  Maybe they were coworkers.  Maybe they were on the same bowling team.  We don’t know the details, but we do know that they loved him and cared about him enough to do something bold about it.\n\nJude 22 says:\n\n> *”and some have compassion, making a difference.”*\n\nSeveral times in scripture it says that Jesus looked at people and was “moved with compassion.”  Compassion is a good thing.  It’s a Christlike thing.  It makes a difference.\n\nIn Jesus’ day, if you came down with some kind of life altering illness like this one, everyone assumed it was because you did something. They assumed it was because of sin.\n\nMany people would have heard about a neighbor coming down with the palsy and thought, “Well, that’s too bad.  I wonder what he did.  Must have been bad.  Looks like the welfare rolls are swelling again.”\n\nBut these guys cared, and they did something about it.\n\nChurch, if we are going to bring people to Jesus, it’s going to take compassion.  We won’t be able to look at people through the eyes of self-righteousness, pat ourselves on the back, and say, “I’m so glad I’m not like that lowlife.”  We’ll have to see people as people Jesus died for, and as people struggling with different symptoms of the same disease we had. We have to have compassion.\n\nYou know you struggle with this sometimes.  I sure do.  Sometimes I see the mess of people’s life, and I want to say, “They brought it on themselves. It serves them right,” but that attitude never once brought a soul to Jesus.\n\nIt takes compassion, and these four guys had a compassionate faith.  \n\nNot only did they have a compassionate faith...\n\n## 2. These four friends had a certain faith.\n\nWhat goes through the mind of someone that would cause them to carry a guy through town on a stretcher to bring them to someone to be healed?  I mean, that’s kind of an imposition.  That’s kind of a difficult task.\n\nThere is no way that these four guys would have done what they did unless they believed two things completely:\n\n1. They had to believe that Jesus *could* heal their friend—that He had the power.\n2. They had to believe that Jesus *wanted to* heal their friend—that He had the desire.\n\nThink about it:  If they thought in their mind, “I don’t know if this Jesus can actually do this,”  there is no way they would have carried a guy through town on a stretcher.  If they thought, “He probably won’t care or want to do anything about it.  He’ll probably be like the other religious teachers who just say, ‘It serves him right,’” there is no way they would do what they did in this passage.\n\nThey had to come to this with absolute certain belief in the willingness and ability of Jesus to heal.\n\nCan I tell you that the reason why many never tell anyone else about Jesus is because they don’t really believe that He can save and heal their friends?  They look at their friends or their coworkers and they think, “That guy is too far gone. That guy is past hope.”\n\nMaybe they think to themselves that Jesus doesn’t really care.  Jesus doesn’t really want to save people.  \n\nFriends, no one is past hope for Jesus.  He is able to save to the uttermost anyone who comes to Him.  Jesus said that if any man comes to Him, He will in no wise cast him out.\n\nJesus wants to save.  Jesus wants to see people saved far more than you or I ever could.   \n\nIf we are ever going to bring people to Jesus, we are going to have to believe with certainty three things:\n\n* God wants to save people.  \n* God can save people.  \n* God is actively working to bring people to Himself.\n\nThese four friends had a compassionate faith and a certain faith. Thirdly...\n\n## 3. These four friends had a determined faith.\nThey carried their friend through town to see Jesus, and there was no way they were getting in.  It was full; jam-packed; slammed.  It was like Cracker Barrel on Mother’s Day; like Game 7 of the Finals.  They weren’t getting in there.\n\nWhat most people would have done at this point—what I probably would have done—was say, “Oh well, looks like it’s not our day. Let’s go home and get some pizza,” But these guys were determined.  They were going to bring their friend to Jesus.\n\nI did a little research this week into the way they build houses in Israel when Jesus lived there.  Most people lived in a one-story house with a flat roof.  The ceiling would have been exposed beams with sticks laid across it.  Then they would seal the sticks with a kind of mud and put about a foot of dirt on top of it.  A lot of houses would even grow grass on the top of their roof.\n\nOn the side of the house, there would be a staircase, and people could walk up the stairs to enjoy the rooftop.  \n\nThese guys carried their friend up to the rooftop, and they started digging.  Imagine being in the house. Imagine hearing noises.  Dirt starts falling through the cracks.  The roof fills with dust. They look up, and there is a hole in the roof.  Sunshine is streaming in.  The hole gets bigger, and four guys are up there with impish smiles on their faces.  Then they take off their belts and lower the stretcher at the foot of Jesus.\n\nThat’s determination.  That’s not taking “No” for an answer.  \n\nIf we are going to bring people to Jesus, it’s going to take determination.  There will always be closed doors.  There will always be opposition.  It’s not ever going to be an easy task where everything goes right.\n\nLazy people work hard at making excuses.  Determined people refuse to take “No” for an answer.  \n\nSometimes it’s going to take a determined faith.  \n\n* Sometimes you’ll have to pray for a friend for years or decades.   Don’t give up.\n* Sometimes you’ll have to share Jesus with someone multiple times.  Don’t give up.\n\nLet me read you something I read recently about the evangelist George Mueller:\n\n> In November 1844, I began to pray for the conversion of five individuals. I prayed every day without a single intermission, whether sick or in health, on the land, on the sea, and whatever the pressure of my engagements might be. Eighteen months elapsed before the first of the five was converted. I thanked God and prayed on for the others. Five years elapsed, and then the second was converted. I thanked God for the second, and prayed on for the other three. Day by day, I continued to pray for them, and six years passed before the third was converted. I thanked God for the three, and went on praying for the other two. These two remained unconverted.\n\n> Thirty-six years later he wrote that the other two, sons of one of Mueller’s friends, were still not converted. He wrote, “But I hope in God, I pray on, and look for the answer. They are not converted yet, but they will be.” In 1897, fifty-two years after he began to pray daily, without interruption, for these two men, they were finally converted—but after he died! \n\nListen folks, Mueller prayed for these guys for over fifty years.  That’s determination.\n\nSo they had a compassionate faith, a certain faith, a determined faith, and look at one more thing with me...\n\n## 4. These four friends had a sacrificial faith.\n\nThese four guys gave up a lot of things in this passage.  They gave up a day. They took the day off to bring their friend to Jesus.\n\nThey gave up their strength.  It had to be hard to carry the man through town and up the stairs.  It had to be exhausting burrowing through the sod covered roof and then lowering him down to Jesus.\n\nThey were probably giving up money, too.  I don’t know about you, but if you put a hole in my roof, even for a good reason, I’d expect you to pay to fix it.  These guys probably understood that.\n\nAnd if we are going to bring people to Jesus, it’s going to take a sacrifice sometimes.  Ministry is a sacrifice.  It takes time.  It takes effort.  It takes strength.  Sometimes it costs you money.\n\nAnd they were definitely risking their reputation.  I mean, they were vandalizing somebody’s house in the middle of a crowd.  A bunch of old ladies sitting in the house probably got dirt all over their dresses. They wouldn’t forget that.  These guys were going to get the reputation of being a little crazy and maybe a little reckless.\n\nBut the rewards are worth it.\n\nYou know the rest of the story: Jesus forgave this man of his sins, and then He healed this man of his palsy.  When people come to Jesus in faith, He saves them and heals them.\n\nWe’ll probably talk about the Pharisees and their reaction as part of next week’s message, but this morning I wanted to talk about the friends who brought a man to Jesus. They cared; they knew Jesus could and would help him; they wouldn’t take “No” for an answer, and they were willing to sacrifice.\n\n## Conclusion\nIs there someone who God is laying on your heart to bring to Jesus?  Is there someone you are praying for?  Working on? Witnessing to?\n\nBringing people to Jesus often requires compassion, certainty that God has the ability and the desire to heal them, determination to overcome obstacles, and a willingness to sacrifice our time, our strength, our property, and our reputation.  \n\nBut when people get to Jesus, it’s worth it all.  When people get to Jesus, their sins are forgiven.  When people get to Jesus, they are born again.  When people get to Jesus, miracles happen.\n\nLet’s be people who are compassionate, determined, and sacrificing to bring others to Jesus, because we know He wants to save them and can.\n\n**Lets’s stand for prayer and invitation.**",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me and turn to Ecclesiastes 11.  Ecclesiastes 11. We’ll do the whole chapter tonight so let’s go ahead and read the whole thing:\n\n> *”1 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty [themselves] upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. 4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap. 5 As thou knowest not what [is] the way of the spirit, [nor] how the bones [do grow] in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. 6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both [shall be] alike good. 7 Truly the light [is] sweet, and a pleasant [thing it is] for the eyes to behold the sun: 8 But if a man live many years, [and] rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh [is] vanity. 9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these [things] God will bring thee into judgment. 10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth [are] vanity.”*\n\nThis is a chapter all about taking risks.  Now, we aren’t talking about being stupid and doing things that probably kill you here and have no benefit, we are talking about normal everyday risks and investments.\n\nProbably, the primary thing that Solomon had in mind here is monetary investments, but it also applies to just investing your time and your talents, and there is a lot of wisdom here.\n\nIf the last chapter was about living wisely, this chapter is about living boldly.  \n\nNow, I want to give you six points tonight.  We’ll walk through this chapter verse by verse and try to understand he points that Someone is making.  \n\nThe first point is found in verse 1:\n\n> *”Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.”*\n\nWhat does that mean?  \n\nWell, I’ve read a lot of commentaries on this and it seems like what its referring to is investment.  Specifically, a shipping venture.\n\nIn the ancient world, one of the best ways to make money in business was to send out a ship on a shipping venture, but there were three problems with it:\n* First, it took forever.  Sometimes it would take a year and a half before your ship got back.\n* Second, you were completely at the mercy of the captain and the decisions he made at sea.\n* Third, it was dangerous, a storm or pirates could ruin your whole investment.\n\nSo what’s Solomon saying here?  Write down number one:\n\n### 1. There is no investment without risk (and waiting).  Invest anyways and reap the rewards later. (1)\n\nThe other day, I was eating a granola bar that Amanda had bought me at B & D and on the wrapper I noticed a quote, so I read it.  The quote said:\n\n> What have you done today that your future self will thank you for?\n\nThat’s a good question, isn’t it.  The truth is, we ought to be doing some things and yes, taking some risks, for a better future, and we also have to understand that those risks are going to take a long time sometimes.\n\nTake a savings account as an example.  I’m not good at saving, but I understand that there are many people who have become comfortably secure just by saving 5-10% of a very small income for a long time.  That’s maybe not going out to eat twice a month.  That’s a sacrifice. And it takes a LONG time to see a return on that sacrifice, but they did.\n\nIt’s kind of like farming.  A farmer makes a huge investment in the seed.  He could have nearly everything in that seed.  He plants it in the ground.  He waits and waits and waits.  Could be a draught or a flood or bugs.  He can’t control that.  But he still has to sow.\n\nSo I guess what Solomon is saying is don’t let risk or delayed satisfaction keep you from doing something that is worthwhile.\n\n---\nLet’s look at the second verse:\n\n> *”Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.”*\n\nWhat does this mean?  Well it could mean be generous.  It could mean, you should diversify.  Really, there isn’t a lot of consensus on what it means, but I think it means this:\n\n### 2. Find something worthwhile and give your self to it. (2)\n\nOr in other words, don’t be a hoarder, be a giver.  Remember the parable of the talents.  The guy with five talents risked and grew those five talents into ten and got “well done thou good and faithful servant.”  The guy with the two talents risked and grew those talents into four and got “well done thou good and faithful servant.” The guy with the one talent buried it. No risk.  No loss.  But no gain either and he got “Thou wicked servant.”\n\nDon’t just play it safe.  Don’t selfishly hoard.  Risk and put it out there.\n\nLook at the third statement:\n\n### 3. You cannot control the circumstances of life.  Try anyways. (3)\n\nVerse 3 says:\n\n> *”If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.”*\n\nYou know the mayhem commercials.  That’s what this reminds me of.  There is one where he is in a tree with a saw, sawing off a limb above someones car.  \n\nThen it says “Mayhem is everywhere.”  \n\nThe truth is, you can’t control the mayhem.  You can’t make all of the the possible bad things in life go away.  The trees are going to fall where they are going to fall and you have no control of it and you don’t know when it’s going to happen.  It might rain, it might not, you have no control.\n\nLife is uncertain.  \n\nYou know what - you can’t control it.  Try though you may, you just can’t control the uncertainty of life.  \nYou can’t avoid it either.  \n\nWhat does Jesus say to this?  Turn to Matthew 6.\n\n> *”[Mat 6:25-34 KJV] 25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? 26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? 27  Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature? 28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, [shall he] not much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith? 31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. 34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day [is] the evil thereof.”*\n\nSo don’t worry about things you can’t control and don’t wear yourself silly trying to control things you really have no control over.\n\n> “Worry is like a rocking chair: it gives you something to do but never gets you anywhere”\n\nRemember, 2 Timothy 1:7\n\n> *”For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.”*\n\n---\n\nLet’s look at the next verse, it caries on the theme:\n\n> *”He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.”*\n\nThe next statement to remember is…\n\n### 4. Don’t get caught in the paralysis of analysis.  (4-5)\n\nThis is talking about the farmer that goes out and checks the weather and says “You know what, it seems like it’s a bit windy today, I’m not going to sow because my grain might get blown away.”  Or in harvest he says “I’m not going to reap because it might rain and I won’t get my crop into the barn in time.”\n\nBut Solomon says if you are always checking the weather, you will never get the job done.\n\nI think the lesson is…\n\n* There will always be some potential pitfall that is a good-enough excuse.  \n\nThese things that the farmer talks about are legitimate issues.  Windy sowing days aren’t good.  Rainy reaping days aren’t good.  But do you know what?  Sowing in the wind is better than not sowing at all.  Reaping in the rain is better than no reaping.  \n\nSo Solomon is saying “Just do it.”  Find something worth doing and just do it.  Don’t wait around for the perfect time.  Don’t wait till you feel like it.  Stop checking the weather, get off Facebook and do something meaningful.\n\n* There will always be things you don’t know.\n* Sow anyways.\n\nCharles Spurgeon used this as an illustration for Soul Winning. IF we wait until it’s just right to sow the gospel, we’ll never sow.\n\n### 5. Work all the time and good things will happen. (6)\n\n\n### 6. Enjoy your life, but prepare for your death (7-10)\n",

    "body": "# 8 Characteristics of the Truly Wise (James 3:17-18)\n\nTake your Bibles with me and turn to James 3.  We are going to read verses 13-18 one more time.  James 3:13-18:\n\n> *”13 Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace. (Jas 3:13-18 KJV)”*\n\nI have had a lot of Sunday nights off over the last several weeks, so it seems like we’ve been inching our way through this passage for FOREVER, but we’ve been talking about real wise guys.  \n\nRemember: This is a passage about who has real spiritual wisdom and who doesn’t.  It’s about whom you should listen to, and it’s not based on *what* they say; it’s based on *who they are* and *how they say it.*\n\nIf you remember from several weeks ago, we talked about the evidence, the lifestyle, and the attitude of someone who really has spiritual wisdom.  You should be able to look at their life and see a difference—not in the way that they dress or in the way that they talk, but in the way they live and their attitude.\n\nThen a week or so after that, I talked about how this passage gives us two things that never, ever go with God-given wisdom, and they are the two sins of envy and strife—wanting what other people have, and this competitive spirit. \n\nThis week, we are going to look at verse 17 and go from negative to positive, talking about what characteristics spiritual wisdom actually has.\n\nThis is a unique list.  There are lists of Christian character traits in the Bible.  We know the “fruits of the Spirit” passage from Galatians.  We know the *“add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge”* passage from 2 Peter.  This is another one of those lists, and it’s completely different.  The wording is completely different, but when you take a step back when we are done, I think you’ll see that this is describing the same thing. \n\nIn other words, what James calls “the wisdom that is from above,” Paul calls “the fruit of the Spirit,” and even though the list is different, they are describing the same thing.\n\nSo let’s look at verse 17 again:\n\n> *”But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.”* \n\nThis verse gives us 8 characteristics of true wisdom.  All I’m going to do tonight is go through them one by one.  It won’t be a long message.\n\nLet’s pray and we’ll get into this.\n\nSo how do you tell someone what has real spiritual wisdom?  How do you tell when someone is worth listening? This verse gives us 8 things to look for.\n\nBefore I give them to you, let me just say this.  Wisdom is incredibly important.  Wisdom is the skill to live your life.  It is the skill to make good, godly decisions.  You don’t have to be smart, but you better be wise.  You don’t have to be good-looking, but you better be wise.  You don’t have to be rich, but you’d better be wise.  More than any other trait, wisdom will help you to live a godly, satisfying life.\n\nWisdom is so important that one of the things Jesus is called in the Bible is Wisdom.  He is Wisdom incarnate, so in a sense, to be wise is to be like Jesus. The more we know Jesus and the more we resemble Him, the wiser we will be.\n\nSo what does wisdom look like?  James has already told us what it doesn’t look like, but here he gives us 8 things you can see in the lives of truly wise people.\n\nFirst, it says *first pure.*. This means that…\n\n## 1. They live pure and chaste lives.\n\nHow are we supposed to be pure?\n\nFirst, I think this means we should be **pure morally**.\n\nA person who has true spiritual wisdom isn’t going to be the rooster trying to have the run of the henhouse.  He’s going to keep himself morally pure. He’s going to be what Timothy calls *the husband of one wife.*. That phrase isn’t talking about divorce; it’s talking about faithfulness and chastity.  \n\nSomeone with real spiritual wisdom is going to be morally pure.  \n\nSecond, someone with real spiritual wisdom is going to be **pure from idolatry and wordiness.** Not only will they not be running around morally, they won’t be running around spiritually.  They aren’t going to go chasing after the false gods of this world.  They are going to follow God and His word.\n\nOne more thing, I think this means they will be **pure doctrinally.** They aren’t going to be teaching a bunch of false doctrine; they are going to do their best to teach the pure truth.\n\nNow this doesn’t mean they will get it 100% right.  No one has gotten it 100% right.  It just means they are going to try.  They are going to care about pure doctrine.\n\nAnd I find it interesting that James said *first pure.* You see, James is going to talk a lot about peace and reasonableness, but we don’t have peace and reasonableness at the expense of purity.  We have to have grace, but we have to have truth, too.  \n\nSo number 1: They live pure and chaste lives\n\nThen the verse says *then peaceable*, so the second thing we look for in people with true spiritual wisdom is…\n\n## 2. They love peace and try to bring peace wherever they go.\n\nI think at some point, peace became a dirty word for Christians.  I don’t know, but maybe it was associated with the hippy movement or something.  But peace and being a peacemaker are both things that the scripture speaks about A LOT.  Jesus said in the Beatitudes, *”blessed are the peacemakers,”* and this chapter ends by saying, *”and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.”*\n\nI don’t think this means “peace at any cost.”  We have to be pure. We have to fight for the truth, but I think it does mean that we shouldn’t be people looking for a fight. In fact, if anything, we should be people looking to end fights and to bring people together.\n\nSometimes I meet or hear of preachers who are very pugilistic.  They just want to fight with everyone about everything.  They love pointing the finger at other preachers around them and telling everyone how wrong they are.  They love being militant.  They craft this persona where they are mad at everything and everybody.\n\nI’m thinking of one preacher down in Georgia. He’s softened up quite a bit now, but he used to send around photos bragging about being “the most controversial preacher in America.”  These pictures would be of him standing in front of a Confederate flag with a scowl on his face wearing boxing gloves.\n\nI think sometimes as Christians, we have to call wrong wrong, but we shouldn’t be pugilistic.   We shouldn’t be any more militant than we absolutely have to be.  We should be peaceful in our demeanor, peaceful in our relationships, and peace-making rather than war-making as much as possible.\n\nWhat does that look like?  I think it means we give people the benefit of the doubt.  I think it means we forgive little infractions.  We try to be people who turn mountains into molehills and not molehills into mountains.  I think it means when we do get at odds with others, we take the initiative and go and make it right, even if they were the ones at fault.  I think it means being big enough to be small and say, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.”\n\nPeaceable.\n\nThe next thing it says is *gentle,* and I think that means…\n\n## 3. They wouldn’t hurt a fly and do their best not to hurt others with their words and actions.\n\nThis is another word that the Bible considers a good thing that we’ve almost made a bad thing.  \n\nOn the wall in my office, I have one Bible verse, it says:\n\n> *”And the servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient.”*. (2 Timothy 2:24)\n\nRemember that “gentleness” and “meekness” are both fruits of the Spirit.  Remember that one of the things they said about Jesus is that He wouldn’t even break a bruised reed.\n\nSo what does it mean to be gentle? I think it means we try really hard not to hurt people.  We try not to hurt people’s feelings.  We don’t make bold brash accusations that we know probably aren’t all true.  We don’t paint with a broad brush.  \n\nSometimes you have to say something that will hurt to do long-term good, but a gentle person knows not to use a battle axe when a pen knife or a scalpel would suffice.\n\nLet me give you an example.  I hate contemporary Christianity and the Church growth movement.  It seems to me like these churches will do almost anything to get people in the door, and that they are preaching watered-down messages and using carnality to reach people. I’m as against that as anyone.\n\nBut I’ve heard some preachers who are also against it say things like, “They are all headed for hell,” or, “They don’t care about anything but their rock music.”   “They don’t even care about the Bible.” “They are a bunch of hellions.”\n\nAnd here is the problem with that: At some point, one of our young people who grows up hearing stuff like that is going to meet a group of sincere Christians who use worship music I disapprove of and who practice this “come as you are” stuff who are really good Christians because there are a lot of them out there.  And they are going to think, “Pastor Hayden called these people hellions. He said they don’t care about the Bible at all.  He said all they care about is rock music, but they really love Jesus.”  And my bombastic rants actually push people towards what I’m ranting about.  I’ve seen that happen.\n\nAnd here is another problem with that: How in the world am I going to win over people who are into that sort of thing if I’m saying things about them that are mean-spirited and untrue?  How many of you have ever had your mind changed by someone making fun of you?  Anyone? \n\nYou’ve got to be gentle.  You’ve got to show people you don’t mean to hurt them.  That’s part of spiritual wisdom.\n\nThe fourth thing in this list is *easy to be entreated.*.\n\nThat phrase is actually two words: A word for “good” and a word for “persuade.”  It literally means “good to persuade.”  It’s another way to describe someone who can be reasoned with—who can actually listen to an argument and to ideas and think about them.\n\n This means when you find someone with true spiritual wisdom…\n\n## 4. They can think through an issue and have their beliefs questioned without going off.  They can have a reasoned discussion without resorting to personal attacks and name-calling.\n\nLet me tell you what I’ve learned about most people: They don’t like questions.  They don’t like any question that casts any doubt into something they hold to be true.  When someone says something that is mostly true but not 100% true, and you ask them a question about it, 99% of the time they go on the attack.\n\nThe only way we come to a deeper understanding of the truth is to ask questions.  That’s how we come to our positions.  That’s how we get our doctrine.  We ask questions.  Then we study out the answers.\n\nIf young people are asking questions, that’s a good thing.  Even if the questions push us and challenge us a bit, we should welcome that.  When they stop asking questions, it means they don’t care anymore, and they’ve stopped thinking about it.  \n\nHonestly, I know a lot of people who are very uncomfortable with questions.  They just want to tell.  They just want to recite a bunch of short quips, but they don’t discuss.  They can’t discuss, and when someone asks them a question, they attack.\n\nThat’s not a sign of true spiritual wisdom.\n\n## 5. They care about hurting people.\n\n*full of mercy*\n\n## 6. They have the evidence of wisdom all over their lives.\n\n*and good fruits*\n\n## 7. They aren’t wishy-washy; you know where they stand.\n\n*without partiality*\n\n## 8. They don’t wear a mask or speak out of both sides of their mouth.\n*without hypocrisy*",

    "body": "# Communicate in All Good Things\n\nYou guys are in for a treat this morning, because the text I’ve come to this morning has to be the most awkward text for a preacher to preach on in the whole Bible.  So you are going to get to see me squirm.\n\nI can tell you, that if I was just making a list of topics to preach to you about, I’d never cover this topic.  It would never even cross my mind.  But because I’m preaching through books of the Bible, trying to cover all of it, this topic is sort of thrust on me this morning and I have to cover it.\n\nWe are going to look at just one verse in Galatians 6 this morning.  Verse 6 says:\n\n> *”Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”*. (Galatians 6:6).\n\nAnd I’m just going to go ahead and let the cat out of the bag - this is a text about paying your pastors well.  \n\nIt is the most self-serving verse for a preacher in the whole Bible.  But it’s still Bible, and I didn’t cherry-pick it, we’ve just come to it, so I’m going to preach it just like I have every other passage we’ve come to while studying the word.\n\n> *”Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”*. (Galatians 6:6).\n\n500 years ago, when Martin Luther was teaching through the book of Galatians for his church people, here is what he had to say about this text:\n\n> *“These passages are all meant to benefit us ministers. I must say I do not find much pleasure in explaining these verses. I am made to appear as if I am speaking for my own benefit.”*\n\nAnd one thing you’ll see as we go on this morning is that this isn’t an isolated passage.  This is a theme.  It’s something that is repeated over and over again in the gospels and in the epistles.  \n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nThere are three important truths in this verse I think are worth talking about and learning.  Let’s pray and then I’ll give them to you.\n\n## This passage teaches us that there are God-appointed teachers and learners\n\nLook at the verse again:\n\n> *”Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”*\n\nI want to show you something that might not be obvious - A big part of God’s plan for church is *teaching.*\n\nTurn with me to Ephesians 4 and let’s read verses 11-15\n\n> *”[Eph 4:11-15 KJV] 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 14 That we [henceforth] be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, [and] cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; 15 But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, [even] Christ:”*\n\nNotice that this passage says that God gave certain gifted people to the church: apostles, prophets, evangelists and pastors and teachers.  The word “and” between pastors and teachers is not the same word as the other “ands” in verse 11.  Pastors and Teachers are meant to go together and be one office.  Pastor/Teachers.  \n\nGod gave pastor/teachers to the church for several reasons according to this passage:\n* First, for the perfecting of the saints.  You need pastor/teachers for Christians to be perfected or “made complete.”  So this means that if there are no pastor/teachers, then Christians will never mature.\n* Second, for the work of the ministry.  This doesn’t mean that its the job of the pastor/teacher to do the work of the ministry.  It means that its the job of the pastor/teacher to prepare the church to do the work of the ministry.\n* Third, For the edifying of the body of Christ.  When the pastor/teacher is doing what He is supposed to be doing, then the church is built up. Numerically, Spiritually, they are growing.\n* Fourth, to protect us from bad doctrine.  You see that in verse 14.  You need pastor/teachers to teach you so you don’t fall into bad doctrine.\n\nAnd the end result of these four things: perfecting, preparing, edifying and protecting, is that we grow up into Christ.  In other words, when the pastor is doing his job of teaching right, the people in the church are growing and maturing and doing more and more in the ministry and we are becoming more and more a Christlike church.\n\nSo listen, you need teaching.  You need a teaching pastor.  It’s an important part of a healthy church.  It’s a big part of what God ordained the church to be.\n\nOutside of the Bible, one of the earliest records we have of what church was like was written by a man named Justin Martyr.  Let me read it to you  how it starts:\n\n> ”On the day called Sunday there is a gathering together in the same place of all who live in a given city or rural district. The memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits. Then when the reader ceases, the president in a discourse admonishes and urges the imitation of these good things. Next we all rise together and send up prayers.”\n\nKind of sounds like one of our church services doesn’t it?  The president (we call him the pastor) reads the scripture, explains and preaches the scripture, and then we pray.  \n\nThat was written sometime around 150 AD.  Listen, this isn’t new.  This is God’s plan.  This is how God builds up his church members.  We need teachers and we need learners.\n\n----\nLook at the verse again:\n\n> *”Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”*\n\nNot only does this passage teach us that there are God ordained teachers and learners…\n\n## This passage teaches us that there is a God-appointed curriculum\n\nNotice that it says *”Let him that is taught **in the word** communicate.”*\n\nGod didn’t just ordain teachers, God gave them something very specific to teach.  They are to teach the word.\n\n2 Timothy 4:2 says to pastors:\n\n> *”Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.”*\n\nWe have back here on the wall some words.  I put them there.  They are a reminder for me.  They come from 2 Timothy 3:16-17:\n\n> *”All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”*\n\nThose verses are a reminder to me that if you are going to be perfect, if you are going to be complete Christians, the things that is going to do it is “all scripture”, and what’s missing from those verses is what I’m supposed to do with all scripture:\n\n* Doctrine - Teach you what is true about God, man and the world we live in.\n* Reproof and Correction - Sometimes my job is to take the Bible and correct you and rebuke you with it.  \n* Instruction in righteousness - Sometimes I’m supposed to take the Bible and teach you how to live.\n\nBut here is the important thing I want you to remember this morning.  I don’t get to make it up!  I’m supposed to take something that God prepared - the Word of God - and just give it to you.\n\nI don’t like everything John MacArthur has said, but I really like what he said about preaching.  He said the job of the preacher is not to be a chef but a waiter. My job isn’t to prepare the meal, it’s to get the meal from the one who made it to you without messing it up.\n\nListen to me, if a preacher doesn’t derive his authority from the word of God - he has nothing to say.  If I’m up here and I’m not preaching the Bible.  Go home.  Go fishing.  Watch NFL reruns.  If I can’t tell you what the Bible says then it’s not worth your time, because believe me, I don’t have anything.  It’s not me.  \n\nFrankly, I’m an uninteresting, mediocre person.  If I had to stand up here and just tell you what I think all the time, I’d run out of things to say in about 1 week.  Because I’m boring and my opinions and my thoughts aren’t worth your time.  \n\nBut do you know what?  I have the privilege, the amazing privilege to bring you what God has said and listen - this book isn’t a dead book, it’s alive.  This book is still speaking to us even though it was written 2,000 years ago.  And this book, if you let it, will still change your life and make you like Christ.  \n\n> *”For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.”* (Hebrews 4:12)\n\n And I get to present it to you every week and hope I don’t mess it up.\n\nIf you come here to hear Ryan Hayden, that’s sad.  But I hope you can look beyond me and learn from the Word every week, because that’s not sad. That’s powerful and amazing.\n\nSo my job, as the pastor, my primary duty is to study and teach and preach the word.  \n* I’m supposed to *”give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.”* (I Timothy 4:13).  \n* I’m supposed to *”Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.”* (2 Timothy 2:15) \n* I’m supposed to *”Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;”*(1 Peter 5:2)\n\nWhatever else I do, my main job is to be a Bible teacher and preacher and to deliver the word to you.\n\n---\n\nSo this passage teaches us that there are God-appointed learners and teachers and a God-appointed curriculum.  But the main thing this passages teaches us is…\n\n## This passage teaches us that there is a God-appointed way of providing for God-appointed teachers\n\nLook at the verse again:\n\n> *”Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”*\n\nThe word “communicate” there does not mean what it means today.  It does not mean “have a conversation with.”  Not at all.  It’s actually closer to the idea of a “commune” or even “communism” than a “conversation” - what it means is to share or to partner with.\n\nMost of the time this word shows up in the Bible it shows up either as “partaker” or “distributor.”  It actually never refers to verbal communication as we use the word today.  It always refers to sharing something physical.\n\nSo, meaning no disrespect to our King James, let’s paraphrase this for our better understanding:\n\n> Let him that is taught in the word share with and distribute to him that teacheth in all good things.\n\n “All good things” here means what it says “all good things” - it means anything that is good for you is good for the preacher.  If you need money, the preacher needs money.  If you need a savings, the preacher needs a savings, if you need to go on vacation, the preacher needs to go on vacation, if you need to save for retirement and help your kids go to school, the preacher needs to save for retirement and help his kids go to school.\n\nIt sounds incredibly self-serving to say this, but this is actually what this passage is teaching.  \n\nThe old puritan Matthew Henry said that this verse was about:\n\n> the free and liberal maintianing of our ministers.\n\nMartin Luther said:\n\n> We have come to understand why it is so necessary to repeat the admonition of this verse. When Satan cannot suppress the preaching of the Gospel by force, he tries to accomplish his purpose by striking the ministers of the Gospel with poverty.\n\nSo there is a principal here that is really simple: *Those who feed and bless you spiritually should be supported by you financially.*\n\nAnd listen, this isn’t isolated to this passage.  This is almost a theme.  It’s all around the scripture.  Turn with me to 1 Corinthians 9.\n\nLook at verse 11:\n\n> *”If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?”*\n\nLook at verse 14:\n\n> *”Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.”*\n\nRead this whole chapter sometime. Paul explains to the Corinthian church why he didn’t take a penny from them, but he makes this really strong case for why that shouldn’t be normal, why they should expect to support and pay their pastors.  The whole chapter is about it.\n\nLook at Romans 15:27\n\n> *”It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.”*\n\nLook at 1 Timothy 5:17\n\n> *”Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.”*\n\nLuke 16:11 \n\n> *”If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?”*\n\nDo me a favor, write these passages down and study them later on your own. What you are going to see is that each of them is about sharing your physical goods with your spiritual teachers.  It’s all over the New Testament.  It’s almost embarrassing.\n\nLook at our text one more time:\n\n> *”Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.”*\n\nRemember how I said a second ago that the word “communicate” there is closer to “commune” than “conversation” - I want to go back to that for a second.  Because the word “communicate” here is a variation of the word Koinanae or Fellowship.  \n\nI think its important that we understand that the relationship isn’t supposed to be a transactional relationship.  Its not like you go to the store and you drop down your five dollars and you get your tub of ice cream and you get a receipt.  That’s the wrong way to think about the relationship between a pastor and his church.  It’s not like you just go in and you plop down your twenty in the offering plate and you get your sermon.  I don’t think “paying” is the right word.  It is “sharing.”  Sharing the good things of life.\n\nThe preacher shares the word, the people share the good things of life with the preacher.  That is the command here.\n\nNow, before I wrap this up, let me say one more thing, just as kind of a caveat to this whole thing.  No preacher should get into the ministry for money and money should never be the motivation for a preacher to preach.  If I ever start thinking “I need to work on my sermon and study so I can get paid” I need to find something else to do.  THat’s not what it’s all about.\n\n\n",

    "body": "Take your Bible with me and turn to Genesis 17. Genesis 17. If your bible has headings over the chapters, very likely chapter 17 says something about “The Abrahamic Covenant.”\n\n”And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly. And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying, As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”\n\n”And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised. And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you. And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.”\n\n”And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be. And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her. Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.”\n\n”And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him. And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son. And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.”\n\nThe dictionary defines “covenant” as a “a contract drawn up by deed.” It is a legal contract.\n\nWhen you said your “I dos” at the alter, you were entering into a covenant. A legal contract. You were making a promise and making that promise legally binding.\n\nWhen you signed the papers on your house or car loan, you probably signed some form of contract. You were making a promise - I will pay such and such every month on this day and in return you will let me keep this car. It was a promise that was legally binding.\n\nIn any covenant - there are usually three elements: The parties are named, the responsibilities of each are laid out, then the covenant is signed or solemnized.\n\nThis covenant is no different.\n\n1. The parties named:\n\nGod names Abraham, Sarah, and Himself as the parties here.\n\n2. The responsibilities described:\n\nGod lays out the responsibilities.\n\n3. The covenant is solemnized:\n\nGod solemnizes the covenant with a ritual.\n\nThe major difference between this covenant and most covenants is that it’s almost entirely one sided.\n\nWhen we first moved here, we had a white car. It was a Nissan Altima. I loved that car. But we bought it off of a friend, and he told us to take care of paying for it when we got up here, so one of the first things we had to do was to get a car loan.\n\nWe didn’t really know our credit score but we knew it wasn’t good. So we asked our bank about a car loan and they said “How’s your credit” and we said “We don’t know, not good” and they said “We can’t help you, go to such and such a place.”\n\nWe didn’t know any better, so we did. I sat down in their office and had no leverage. I thought my credit was terrible. I was at their mercy. It wasn’t a negotiation - it was a surrender. Of course they took advantage of me. It was a one-sided contract.\n\nLater I found out my credit wasn’t as bad as I thought and the bank probably could have given me a loan. It was a very expensive mistake.\n\nHere in our text Abraham has even less leverage. He has nothing. He isn’t in a place to negotiate - he’s in a place to surrender. It’s like the contract countries sign when they have been defeated in war. He is at the mercies of God.\n\nBut this isn’t like most contracts - because God promises to give, give, give, and asks very little in return. It’s a precursor to salvation - where God gives us salvation by His grace - it’s His work and not our own.\n\nThe first thing I want you to see about this is...\n\n1. God does the promising.\nLook at verse 4-8\n\n”As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations. Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee. And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”\n\nNotice how many times in these verses God says “I Will”:\n\nI will make thee exceeding fruitful\nI will make nations of thee\nI will establish my convenient between me and thee\nI will give unto thee .. the land\nI will be their God.\nThat’s just in these verses. A total of 11 times in this chapter God says “I will do something.”\n\nHere is the unique thing about this covenant - it’s all the work of God. God promises to work miracles in making Abraham fruitful, He promises to work miracles in giving Abraham an everlasting kingdom, He promises that He will give Abraham a huge portion of land. It’s all the work of God.\n\nAnd in return - what does God expect from Abraham? A simple act of circumcision. Get circumcised, circumcise your children and servants, and in the future, make sure your baby boys are circumcised when they are eight days old.\n\nThat’s it.\n\nNow, I want to point out two things about this act of circumcision:\n\nA. Circumcision is a trivial requirement.\nThis would be like going into a car dealership and the dealer saying “Pick out the car you want” so you go over and you find a car you can afford and the dealer says “No, you can do better than that - if you could get anything what would you pick” And you say “Well, if I could have ANYTHING I’d probably buy a cadillac truck. You know, one of those $120,000 rigs. But that’s more money than I make in four years.\n\nAnd the dealer says, I’ll tell you what - I’m not going to sell you this truck for $120,000, I’m going to sell you the whole dealership. All of the cars and trucks I have, and in return, lets see, your old beater has one of those fragrant trees hanging from the rear view - give me that.\n\nIt’s trivial. It’s like “I’ll give you millions of dollars for, lets see, that gum wrapper over there.”\n\nIt’s a trivial requirement. More of a token than anything else.\n\nSecond, see that...\n\nB. Circumcision is a illustrating requirement.\nNot only was circumcision trivial when you compare what you get, it was also meant to illustrate that it’s all about God’s work and not ours. Here is what a preacher named Terry Trivette said:\n\n“The sign itself testified of a truth regarding the relationship between Abram and God. Circumcision is a cutting back of the flesh. It reminded all who underwent it that they were not to depend upon their own flesh, but upon the work of God.”\n\nYou see, the act itself was meant to illustrate that it is God who is doing this thing - not us. It’s a work of grace - not flesh.\n\nSo the promises were laid out by God - no negotiation - just promises but they were grace promises. It reminds us of Ephesians 2:8-9:\n\n”For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”\n\nLook at the second point with me...\n\n2. God does the naming.\nRemember I said that a covenant includes promises - it also clearly includes names. One interesting thing about this chapter is that it doesn’t just include names - every party gets a new name! There are three new names in this chapter, a new name for God, a new name for Abram, and a new name for Sarai.\n\nA. God’s new name: El Shaddai - The All Sufficient One\nGod’s new name here speaks to His ability and His power to do what He promises. It’s all on Him. He is all sufficient.\n\nIt reminds me of Ephesians 3:20 which says:\n\n”Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,”\n\nGod can do it, He is going to do it.\n\nThen God gives Abram a new name. He calls Him...\n\nB. Abram’s new name: Abraham - the father of many nations\n“Abram” means “exalted father.” At this point his name is kind of silly - I mean he had no kids for so long. His name probably hung over him like a sick joke. But his new name means “The father of many nations.”\n\nLastly, God renames Sarai.\n\nC. Sarai’s new name: Sarah - Princess\nWe don’t really know what Sarai meant - most think it meant something like “like a princess” but her new name means “princess.” Do you know what princesses do? They give birth to kings.\n\nSo, God set’s the terms here, He does the promising, and He does the naming.\n\nLook at Abraham’s reaction in verses 17-18:\n\n”Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?”\n\nHe laughed. Now, at first this might seem disrespectful. But I don’t think that it actually was. Romans 4:19-20 says:\n\n”And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;”\n\nThis wasn’t the laughter of unbelief - I think it was just the laughter of joy. The laughter of faith. It was the same laughter you and I get when we are talking about something God did in our life that only God can do in our life.\n\nBut that joy snaps back when Abraham thinks of his living son - Ishmael and Abraham pleads with God “O that Ishmael might live before thee!”\n\nAgain, I don’t think this is Abraham being unfaithful here - I think he just loves his son. And so God says:\n\n”And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.”\n\nThis brings me to my last point tonight:\n\n3. God does the doing.\nGod tells Abraham two things:\n\nFirst, this covenant is going to be done...\n\nA. In his own way.\nThis isn’t going to be a covenant for Ishmael - but for a new son, born of Sarah, named Isaac.\n\nDo you know what Isaac means - it means laughter. God was recognizing Abraham’s laugh. But it’s going to be Isaac.\n\nNow, God doesn’t leave Ishmael out. He promises Abraham that Ishmael will be blessed too. He will be a great nation. But this covenant isn’t about Ishmael who represents the flesh, it’s about Isaac who represents the spirit.\n\nThe second thing we see is that God is going to do it...\n\nB. In his own time.\nSarah is going to have a baby “at this set time in the next year.” God had a set time for Isaac all along and He was going to work it out in His time, not in Abrahams.\n\nThe passage ends with simple obedience - Abraham goes out and circumcises his Ishmael, his servants and then himself. He immediately starts using the new names God had given them - an act of faith - and then not long after this, Sarah feels the growth of a baby boy in her womb.",

    "body": "The Request - Verses 1a, 9-10, 11b\nJudge me - David isn't asking boastfully \"God, check me out, you won't find anything wrong here.\" His request to be judged is a request for vindication.\n\nApparently, people were accusing David of things he wasn't guilty of. Their were probably people who were trying to spin David's life mischievously. They were trying to get rich off of lies about David.\n\nDo you ever feel like God needs to vindicate you? Do you ever feel like people judge you without a cause and accuse you of things you didn't do? Do you ever feel lied about?\n\nMaybe, you are going through hardships and other people think \"they deserve that\" and you feel like you need God to vindicate you. That is the request David is making here.\n\nThe Case - Verses 2-5\nWe can learn a lot about Godliness and what it looks like by looking at verses 2-5.\n\nDavid wasn't perfect. He made some major mistakes in life. But he was a godly person.\n\nCan I stop for a second? Listen - we have a tendency to judge others by a standard we couldn't pass. One big sin does not make someone a bad person - one area of personal failure doesn't make someone evil - it makes them human.\n\nAll of us have some area that, were we to stand before Christ, we wouldn't want the search light to linger on. All of us have things in our past. All of us have mistreated people. It doesn't make it right and we should seek forgiveness when we realize it. But it happens.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that one sin doesn't mean someone isn't godly in the segregate. Do you know that with David, the later kings were judged whether or not \"they walked in the ways of David their father.\" Even with David's major failure - he was still considered by God to be a godly man.\n\nSo this chapter isn't David saying \"I've never done anything wrong.\" What David is saying, justly, is that he has honestly tried to live a godly life.\n\nNow, look at how he characterizes that:\n\nEmotionally and Intellectually Right\nHe asks God to \"try the reins and the heart.\" In Bible times, the heart was considered to be the source of your thinking. The reins were a word for kidney. The reins or bowels were considered the source of your emotions. What David is saying here is that as much as possible, he's tried to live without sin in his thinking and in his emotions.\n\nToday we'd say \"try my heart and mind.\"\n\nBy the way - that is what God cares about. He cares about what is going on in your heart and what is going on in your head. If you think right and God has control over your heart and head, your life will evidence that.\n\nHow can you live with a right heart and mind? You actually see it in the next three verses:\n\nLiving by the scriptures.\nHe says in verse 3 \"I have walked in your truth\". He's living by the Bible. He loves the Word of God.\n\nAvoiding evil influences\nVerses 4-5\n\nThe Commitment - 1, 6-7, 11a, 12\ncommitment to avoid backsliding 1\ncommitment to worship 6, 12\ncommitment to publish the good news of God 7\ncommitment to be thankful 7 s",

    "body": "Tonight we are going to look at the life of Isaac. Genesis 26 is the only chapter in the Bible that is dedicated entirely to Isaac. Even though he lived longer than any of the other patriarchs in Genesis, very little is said about him.\n\nOne preacher said that Isaac was the ordinary son of an extraordinary father, and the ordinary father of an extraordinary son. That's probably a fair description of this guy. He was neither hero nor villain, neither great nor bad. He was just kind of ordinary. Kind of normal.\n\nIt seems like the peak of Isaac's life came when he was just a boy and went with his father up on mount Moriah to be offered. The peak of his life spiritually came when he was just a kid. As sad as that sounds, there are many people who served God as a teenager or who made a commitment to God at a camp when they were 14 and that was the extent of their spirituality. They just sort of lumber on after that.\n\nLet's read Genesis 26 and I'll give you a little bit of an outline.\n\n\"[Gen 26:1-35 KJV] 1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 7 And the men of the place asked [him] of his wife; and he said, She [is] my sister: for he feared to say, [She is] my wife; lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she [was] fair to look upon. 8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac [was] sporting with Rebekah his wife. 9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she [is] thy wife: and how saidst thou, She [is] my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 10 And Abimelech said, What [is] this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 11 And Abimelech charged all [his] people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. 12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. 13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. 15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water [is] ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba. 24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I [am] the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I [am] with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. 25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. 26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, [even] betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; 29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou [art] now the blessed of the LORD. 30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city [is] Beersheba unto this day. 34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.\"\n\nI'm not going to work all the way through this passage and tell you what happens. In many ways, it parallels the life of Abraham. Isaac had to deal with the ups and downs of life just like his father and he had to deal with the lost world just like his father. This passage just tells that story.\n\nThe way I want to approach this is by talking about what Isaac got from various sources. So, four points: What Isaac got from his dad, from the world, from God and for himself. Under each point I think we'll see two things Isaac got.\n\nLet's pray and we'll jump in.\n\nThe first thing I want us to see is:\n\n1. What Isaac Got From His Dad\nIt's obvious that Isaac got a lot from his dad. You almost see as much of Abraham in this passage as you see of Isaac, even though Abraham is dead. It's a case study in how much of an impact we can have on our children.\n\nNotice first that Isaac got faith from his dad.\n\nIn verse 2, God appears to Isaac and warns him not to go to Egypt during a famine. That's Abraham's God and it was obviously Isaac's God too. God reminds Isaac of the promises he had made to Abraham and warns him about going to Egypt.\n\nHe tells him to stay in Gerar and that God will take care of him there. Then, throughout the chapter we see Isaac following God. He's not always successful at it, but at least he's trying.\n\nI recently read of a study where they followed sets of identical twins who were separated at birth. The twins had the exact same DNA but were raised in different homes. The result of the study was that in almost every area, much more was determined by nature than nurture. Your DNA has a bigger impact on who you become than who raises you. But one big exception was religion. People almost always got their religion from their parents.\n\nIsaac was raised in the home of godly Abraham and followed his Father's god. Our children won't nescessarily follow our God. Lot's of godly kings of Israel had wicked sons. Eli was a godly man - Hophni and Phinneas were hellions. David was a godly man, Absolom was wicked as Ahab. Even Isaac's two sons weren't both godly. But we do have a huge influence on our kids. They see our faith. They see how we live for God and they can follow that.\n\nThe second thing Isaac got from his dad was his dad's failures.\n\nWhen you read the first part of this, it's like Dejavu. Abraham faced a famine two times and both times he repeated the same sin. He lied about his wife. He said she was his sister. Isaac in this passage does the same thing to the same kings, he says Rebekah is his sister.\n\nIt's only when the king sees Isaac flirting with Rebekah that he figures it out and chastises Isaac for it. But it's the exact same sin that Abraham was twice guilty of.\n\nThe lessons should be obvious. Our kids can emulate what's best about us, but they can also emulate our bad habits. We can be their example and we can be their excuse. Let's strive to be their example.\n\nSo that is what Isaac got from his dad. Let's look secondly at\n\n2. What Isaac Got From The World\nIsaac went to Gerar. That was a sort of half-way house for Egypt. It was the land of the Philistines. He had to deal with the same king - Abimelech - that his dad did.\n\nHis father had made a treaty with Abimelech. Isaac should have had free access to all of Abimelech's lands. But the Philistines got jealous of Isaac and started agitating him.\n\nThe way this played out was in wells. Abraham dug some wells and Abimelech's men would go and fill the wells in.\n\nAbimelech's men are a great picture of the world, and what Isaac got from them is what we can expect to get from the world.\n\nFirst, he got Rejection\n\nWhen those men filled in his wells, they were making a statement. They were saying \"we don't want none.\" We don't want or need what you have.\n\nThe wells are a great picture of Jesus. Remember, Jesus compared himself to a well that you could drink from and never thirst again. Some commentators say that Abraham digging these wells was almost an act of evangelism. He was trying to help people - yet they filled them in. They didn't want anything to do with Abraham's God or Abraham's wells.\n\nChurch, we have to expect that we are going to get some rejection from the world. Jesus was rejected when he was on this earth by far more people than received him. This world has never been a friend of grace. Some will believe, but many - sadly most - will fill in the wells.\n\nThe second thing Isaac got from the world was Resistance\n\nIsaac wasn't just using Abraham's well, he was trying to dig his own, and twice he dug wells only to have the Philistines, who were supposed to be his friends, come back behind him and fill them in.\n\nYou can see how frustrated Isaak was in what he named these wells: He named one of these wells Esek - which means contention. He named one Sitnah which means contempt and he named one rehoboth which means something like they just don't care.\n\nIsaak was frustrated by the resistance of the world. They didn't just reject what he was doing, they actively opposed it.\n\nChurch, as we go through the world as pilgrims, they are going to oppose us too. They are going to try to get in the way of gospel preaching. They are going to try to make it difficult for Christians to live out their faith. That's part of living in this world.\n\nSo Isaac got faith and failures from his dad, he got rejection and resistance from the world. Let's look next at...\n\n3. What Isaac Got From His God\nThis passage actually starts with God giving something to Isaac. In verse 2 God appears to Isaac and says\n\n\"Go not down to Egypt\"\n\nIsaac's life was hard with the Philistines, but it would have been much worse in Egypt. God was kindly giving him warning.\n\nGod also gives us a lot of warnings. We don't usually think of warning as a gift, but they are. Sometimes the kindest thing you can do for people is to show them where the trail they are on ends, or tell them the bridge is out.\n\nWe have a whole book here of warnings and lessons that God gives us. We can be wise and we can listen to those warnings. Or we can be foolish and ignore them, but we cannot turn and say to God that He never told us. It's right here for us in His word.\n\nThe second thing that Isaac got from God was blessing. Because Abraham believed God and Isaac believed God, God blessed him. Everything Isaac touched was blessed. When he planted, he got an incredible yield. When he dug, he found water. God was blessing him.\n\nAgain, the lesson here is pretty obvious: When we heed God's warnings, He blesses us. When we honor and respect our parents, when we seek after wisdom and run from the world, blessings come from that. When we ignore God's \"the bridge is out\" signs, well, most of the time we go off the cliff and are hurt from it.\n\nOne more thing I want to show you in this story and that is:\n\n4. What Isaac Got For Himself\nEven though Isaac was Abraham's son and he got a bunch of blessings from being Abraham's son, he couldn't let Abraham live his life for him.\n\nIsaac had to make his own decisions. He had to decide whether he was going to obey God. He had to decide whether he was going to lie about Rebekah. He had to decide the kind of person he was going to be.\n\nOur parents might be great Christians or they might be hellions - it doesn't matter - we each have to stand before God and answer not for what our father or mother did, but for what we have done. We will each give an account for our own actions. We will be responsible for us and only us.\n\nListen folks, that's kind of a liberating thing to grasp. You aren't responsible for the hand you are dealt in this life, you are responsible for how you play it. You could come from total privilege and squander it - plenty of people did that in the Bible. You could also come from a horrible situation and live for God - people did that too. But it's up to you what you do with Jesus and what you do with God.\n\nThe second thing we see is Isaac had to dig his own wells. He inherited some of the wells from his father, but he still had to dig his own.",

I took about two months off to go through the “I Ams” of Jesus in John, but we are going to come back to Galatians and finish it up for the next several months.\n\nGalatians is a book that is all about grace.  It is all about the fact that Salvation is a free gift from God.  And that we can’t add anything to it.\n\nYou know this already, but I’m going to remind you of it anyways because some people are new to this:  Galatians was written to a group of churches in a region called Galatia (which is in Turkey today).  These churches were gentile churches.  (Like we are a Gentile church.). They were not made up of people who had a jewish background.\n\nBut some jewish people who called themselves Christians had started going through these Galatians churches and preaching to them that if they really wanted to be Christians, then they had to obey the law from the Old Testament too.  They had to be circumcised.  They had to keep the feasts and the sabbath.  They had to go through the whole law and basically become jews.\n\nAnd this whole book of Galatians is just Pauls reaction to this.  It goes into so much detail about how we are saved by grace through faith, not by works.  It talks about how we have been adopted as Children into God’s family and how we have become heirs of God.  It talks about how it’s all grace, it’s all a gift from God that we didn’t merit.  And religion has no part in it.  Works has no part in it.  We are saved by faith and we live by faith.  We are saved by grace and we live by grace.\n\nYou see religion says “do.”  Do this work.  Do that work.  Don’t do this.  Do this.  Be a good person.  Be respectable.  Give.  Come to church over and over again.  Keep this moral code.  Do. Do. Do. Do. Do.\n\nEvery single religion - whether it’s islam or judaism or bhudism or hinduism or taoism or various Christian cults - every single one of them is just man trying to do enough to make God happy.  It’s all us trying to work our way up to God.\n\nBut true Christianity isn’t a “do” religion.  Jesus didn’t come here to say “do”.  The truly Christian message isn’t “Do.”  The true Christian message is “done.”\n\nYou see it’s called the “Gospel.”  “Gospel” means good news.  News means it’s already happened.  It’s not the “good advice” it’s the good news.\n\nI want you to imagine that you’ve been trying to buy a house.  You have a beautiful house on Western picked out and you’re trying to do everything in your power to scrape together $30,000 dollars to put down as a downpayment and get a mortgage to get that house.  \n\nSo you’re taking an extra job.  You’re picking up shifts at Dominoes.  You’re selling your stuff.   You’re buying lottery tickets.  I mean, every get rich quick scheme that is out there you are trying.  You are buying every book by Dave Ramsey and by Suze Orman and by Robert Kiywasaki.  You are listening to Tony Robbins and to Zig Ziglar and anyone else you think is going to make me rich enough to buy that house.  Every new thing that comes along you are doing and you are just wearing yourself out and sadly, you are getting nowhere.\n\nAnd someone comes along and they say “I’ve got good news for you, you can have that house.”  And you say, ok, tell me what I have to do.  What plan do I have to sign up for.  Do I sell Lula Row, do you have a new job for me, did you find a banker who can set me up with a new long term loan.  Please tell me what I have to do to get this new house!  I’m desperate.  It’s my dream.\n\nAnd the person says “No, you don’t understand.  I don’t have good advice for you.  I have news for you.  You can have the house.  It’s yours.  Someone paid for it.  Just walk up to the front door and you’ll find the door is unlocked and inside there is a deed with your name on it.”\n\nYou say “I don’t understand.  What do I need to do.”  And the person says “Nothing, it’s already done.  Just take it.”\n\nThat is the difference between Christ and religion.  Religion, all religion, is just a bunch of different people saying “do.”  When Jesus says “done.”  Religion says “this is what you have to pay.”  Jesus says “I’ve already paid it for you.”  Religion says “be good”, Jesus says “I was good for you.”  Religion says “Get an A on the test.”  Jesus says “I took the test for you, I got a 100, just accept my score.”\n\nAgain, it’s a “do” thing vs. a “done” thing.\n\nAnd listen, if you have trusted Christ as your savior.  If you’ve accepted his “done” then you don’t have to worry about the “do”s anymore.  You can stop working yourself into the grave trying to buy that mansion - someone already bought it for you.  You’ve been set free from the “do”s by what Christ has done.\n\nNow, with that in mind, let’s read Galatians 5:1-6\n\n> *”1 Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 2 Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. 5 For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. 6 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.”*\n\nThey say that in Thailand you can go and you can see these huge elephants that can just walk through houses and cary trees around with their trunks.  Massive, insanely strong animals.  Some of the strongest things God created.  But it’s actually a pretty common thing for Elephants to be domesticated and all you have to do to keep an Elephant in place is just put a ring with a rope around it’s neck that is tied to a pole.\n\nNow think about this, an elephant could break that rope like a little piece of fishing line.  I mean just snap it with almost zero effort.  But they don’t. \n\nThe reason they don’t is because when they were babies, those ropes could hold them.  They pulled and they pulled against those ropes until eventually they just gave up trying.  Then after awhile, it just got engrained in them that if that rope was around their neck it was no use.\n\nSo now, all around the world there are these massive animals so strong they could pull down a tree.  Yet they are staying in place by a tiny rope.  All they need for their freedom is just to walk away, but they are bound.\n\nGalatians has been teaching us for four chapters now that we are free from the “dos” of religion.  That we are saved by grace.  That we don’t need circumcison anymore.  We don’t need the religious system of the jews anymore.  We are free.\n\nLook at verse 1:\n\n> *”Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”*\n\nYou’ve been set free!  You are free from the “dos” because of what Jesus has “done.”  \n\nBut do you know what these Galatians were doing, the same thing a lot of Christians today are doing, even though they can just walk away from the “dos” they go right back to it.\n\nDo you know what a “yoke” is?  A yoke is something you put on an ox or a horse then attach to a wagon.  It basically sticks you to the wagon and makes you work.\n\nIf you are trying to please God by a checklist of dos and don’ts.  If you are trying to earn God’s favor through religious works or traditions or ceremonies or through giving or through tithing or through church attendance or through any number of things.  Do you know what you are doing?  You are putting the yoke back on.\n\nHave you ever seen Ben Hur?  I love that old movie.  You know the scene where he is in the hull of the ship as a galley slave and he is just rowing away and he is in bondage.  He’s been there for years.  Then another ship comes ramming into them and his shackles are loose and he can get away.  He’s free!  How crazy would it be for Ben Hur to swim back into that ship and put the shackles back on and say ‘You know, I think I like rowing.’  That would be CRAZY!  \n\nBut that is sort of what these Galatians were doing, they were saved by grace through faith and yet they couldn’t believe that that was enough so they were running right back to religion and putting the shackles back on.\n\nThe jews really liked this phrase “the yoke.”  Whenever a jew in Jesus day got serious about studying Judaism, they would say he was “putting on the yoke.”  But here Paul said “Don’t be entailed again with the yoke of bondage.”\n\nIt kind of reminds me of Jesus.  When Jesus was on the earth dealing with these crazy religious Judaisers, remember he said to them… \n\n> *”[Mat 11:28-30 KJV] Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.”*\n\nIn Acts 15, the early church leaders met together to discuss what they were going to do with the gentiles and that word “Yoke” came up again referring to religion, Peter said:\n\n> *”Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?”*\n\nSo here is the idea, and it’s our first point:\n\n\n## 1. Religion is slavery. \n\nReligion, or any kind of self-salvation, is a yoke.  It’s a hamster wheel.  It’s a grueling awful treadmill.\n\nThe truth is if you are trying to save yourself by being good enough - it’s never going to happen - you’ll never be good enough.\n\n* There will always be more church services to attend.\n* There will always be more classes to teach.\n* There will always be more projects to do.\n* There will always be more people to give to.\n* There will always be things for you.\n\nAnd if you are trying to earn God’s favor by doing, it’s a yoke.  It’s shackles.  It’s slavery.\n\nPaul says: \n\n> *”be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”*\n\n\nHere is my second point this morning:\n\n## You have been set free from religion.\n\nThe point of religion.  The whole point is self-salvation.  The whole point is earning favor with God.  Trying to earn enough brownie points for God to like you and accept you and to maybe offset some of the bad things you’ve done.  \n\nBut here is the thing we Christians need to remember.  We don’t need to earn God’s favor.  It’s been given to us through Jesus.  We don’t need to earn forgiveness, it’s been given to us through Jesus.  We don’t need to earn righteousness, it’s been given thus through Jesus.\n\nThe mansion has been deeded to you.  It’s a gift, you don’t have to work for it.\n\nLook at the first phrase of verse 1 again…\n\n> *”Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free”*\n\nIf you have trusted Christ - you have been set free.  Period.  It’s a past tense thing.  You’ve been emancipated from religion.\n\nThere was a fateful day in our country when President Lincoln gave the Emancipation Proclamation and in one sweep of a pen, millions of people stopped being slaves and were set free.  The one thing they wanted more than anything, their freedom, was theirs.  They just had to believe it.  \n\nChurch, the cross of Christ is our spiritual emancipation proclamation from the deeds of religion.  If you are here this morning because you are hoping to earn favor with God, if you do what you do to earn God’s favor, you are putting the shackles back on.  \n\nBut these verses are making another point:\n\n## 3. You have to chose between Christ and Religion.\n\nLook at verses 2-4:\n\n> *”Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 3 For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. 4 Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.”*\n\nNow, I want you to understand something - this isn’t talking about losing your salvation.  Every commentary I read on this says that this is talking about Christians who are already saved, talking about how they live their Christian life, not about losing your salvation.\n\nThese Galatians were gentiles.  They weren’t circumcised.  They had believed in Jesus and now some jews were telling them that if you really want to please God and be a good Christian, you have to do the jewish stuff too and be circumcised.\n\nAnd Paul says “no”.  You have to make a choice:  \n\n\n* Are you going to trust what Christ has done for you or are you going to try to keep doing it yourself?  \n* Are you going to trust Christ or are you going to trust the law?\n* Are you going to live a “do” life or are you going to live a “done” life? \n\nYou have to choose - religion or Christ.  But if you choose religion, then you are going to be putting the shackles back on and you are going to be missing all of the spiritual power and the freedom that comes from Christ and from Grace.\n\nGod wants us to \n\n> *”Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”*\n\nNow, this has been a very doctrinal message and a little bit abstract, so let me conclude this morning by spending a few minutes telling you what I think this means for you:\n\n# Conclusion\nHere is what I think this means for us…Some of you need to… \n\n## Trade working for trusting.\n\nI’ve talked to many of you before about your salvation before and many times some will come to me and they will say “Pastor, I don’t know if I’m saved.  I just don’t feel like I’m doing enough.  Maybe I didn’t pray hard enough. Maybe I didn’t come down at the altar. Or, I’ve done bad things since I was saved.”\n\nIt may be possible that you’ve never been saved, but in either case, what you need to do is the same - you need to just trust what Jesus has done for you on the cross and take yourself out of it.  It’s all because of Christ and what He has done, not because of you and what you have done.\n\nYou will never do enough to get saved.  You will never be good enough to get saved.  You can’t pray hard enough to get saved.  Because it’s not about what you do - it’s about what Jesus did.  All you need to do is trust Jesus.  Stop looking for the next circumcision and start standing in the freedom which Christ has made you free.  Stop looking for the next “do” and rest in the “done.”\n\nSome of you need to take this verse and you need to…\n\n## Trade guilt and obligation for gratitude.\n\nChurch isn’t supposed to be a “have to” thing - it’s supposed to be a “get to” thing.  We live the Christian life because it is a joy and because it is a gift, we don’t live it because we are trying to earn God’s love and favor.\n\n\n## Trade legalistic rule-following for Spirit-led Christ following.",

    "body": "# Ladies -   Do you match?\nIt’s customary for a preacher to stand up on Mother’s Day and give a sentimental message about moms.  We are going to talk about mothers this morning, but we aren’t going to limit it to that.\n\nGodly mothers are a powerful force for good in this world.\n\nMoses only had a short time with his godly mother, but apparently she sowed seeds in him that enabled him to give up being a prince in Egypt and to *“choose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.”* There would be no Moses without Jochabed.  Godly mothers are powerful.\n\n* No Sarah - No Isaac.\n* No Hannah - No Samuel.\n* No Mary - No Mark.\n* No Eunice and Lois - No Timothy.\n\nEven Jesus was influenced by a godly mother.  Godly mothers are powerful.\n\nMoms, you will never know how much influence you can have over your children.  If you have a godly mom, you’ve been blessed by God, and you need to tell her you love her and thank her.  \n\nBut I don’t want to limit this mother’s day message to just moms today.  Instead I’m going to speak directly to all you ladies.  Men, you can check out and think about fishing or something.  Just kidding; you need to hear this, too.  \n\nLadies, you don’t just happen to be a godly mom or a godly lady.  You don’t just pop out that way.  It’s something to learn, and it’s something to strive for.\n\nWe are going to look at a passage this morning that talks about the kind of ladies we need and gives some specific things ladies should strive for in their lives.\n\nTurn with me to Titus 2, and we’ll read verses 1-5.\n\n> *”1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine: 2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience. 3 The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 5 [To be] discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.”*\n\nThere is this lady at my wife’s church in Dalton that we call “Don’t Match.”  We don’t call her that because she dresses poorly. She’s actually one of the best dressed ladies I’ve ever met.  We call her that because, when my wife was a three-year-old little girl, she bumped into this lady in that bathroom at church and told her that nothing she was wearing matched. That was more than thirty years ago, and every time they see each other now, they are duty-bound to tell each other that they don’t match.\n\nThe question this passage puts forth to you ladies is, “Do you match?”\n\nNotice the phrase in verse 1.  \n\n> *”Speak thou the things that become sound doctrine.”*\n\nAnd then in verse 3:\n\n> *”The aged women likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness.”*\n\nThe word “become” or “becometh” there means “match.”  What this passage is saying to us is that there are certain behaviors that match sound doctrine and certain behaviors that match holiness.  If you profess to be a Christian and a saved person, then there are certain behaviors and lifestyles that match that profession.\n\nI have been known to not match from time to time. When I was a third and fourth grade teacher, I used to have these dress shoes I was very fond of.  They were wing tips that were this reddish-brown color—kind of the color of mud in Tennessee.  They were almost orange, and I used to wear them all the time at school.\n\nOne day, I was teaching math or something, and this little meek girl in my class name Mary raised her hand.  “Yes Mary, do you have a question?”  “Um, Mr. Hayden, I just wanted to let you know. You think those shoes match everything, but they don’t really match anything.”\n\nOuch.  \n\nSome things just don’t go together, and when you put them together, it leaves a bad taste in people’s mouth.  I love coffee and I love cranberry juice, but I’m not going to be mixing them together anytime soon.  I love Japanese food and I love Italian food, but the thought of having wasabi on my pasta makes my stomach churn.   Cracker Barrel is great, and lattes are great, but have you noticed that Cracker Barrel is pushing lattes now? Some things just don’t go together.\n\nPaul was saying here that some behaviors and lifestyles match the gospel.  They match good teaching.  They match holiness.  That means other lifestyles and behaviors don’t match the gospel and good teaching.  \n\nLet me just stop and say this: You are saved by grace through faith alone.  Salvation is not a works thing.  Salvation is accomplished by Jesus and all we have to do is believe.  But hear this: After you are saved, God does expect you to live differently.  God expects you to have a different lifestyle than the lost world around you.\n\nJesus said in Matthew 5, *”Ye are the light of the world,”* and *”Ye are the salt of the earth.”* Light and salt are both **different.**  God expects us as Christians to live differently than the world lives.  There ought to be a contrast.\n\nSo Paul lays out all of these things in our life that should be different here, and I want to focus on what he told the ladies.\n\nLook again at verses 3-5:\n\n> *”3 The aged women likewise, that [they be] in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 5 [To be] discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.”*\n\nIn this passage, we see things Christian ladies are to avoid, things Christian ladies are to be, and things Christian ladies are to do.\n\n***Let’s pray and we’ll jump into this passage.***\n\nThe first two things I want you to see here are...\n\n# 1. Things Christian ladies are to avoid:\nPaul starts by telling ladies—in this case particularly older ladies—two things they need to stay away from and watch out for. They are slander and drunkenness.  So let’s look at those:\n\n## A. Slander\n Paul says: \n\n> *”The aged woman likewise...not false accusers.”*\n\nApparently, there is a particular temptation among older ladies to sow discord and to gossip.  Paul is saying to these ladies, “You need to watch out for this.  You need to avoid this.  Don’t say things about people that aren’t 100% true.  Don’t be a gossip.”\n\nYears ago, we did a Christmas play about a preacher coming to a new small town church, and two of the funniest characters were two old ladies sitting on either side of the auditorium next to a phone just gossiping away and exaggerating everything.  That was funny, but it’s not funny when it really happens.  It can be a source of destruction, and it doesn’t match the gospel, so avoid slander.\n\nThe second thing Paul said for older ladies to avoid is...\n\n## B. Drunkenness\n\n> *not given to much wine.*\n\nNow, I have to admit, in my experience as a pastor, I’ve never met many older ladies who were “given to much wine,”  and certainly not in the church.  But apparently, it was a particular problem in Paul’s time.\n\nI think we can expand “given to much wine” here to include any kind of substance abuse, whether it’s alcohol or pills.  Be careful here.\n\nSo there are things to avoid.  \n\n* Avoid wearing stripes with plaid.\n* Avoid wearing white after Labor Day.\n* Avoid wearing socks with sandals.\n* Avoid putting cinnamon in anything but a dessert.\n* Avoid mixing Christianity with gossip and drunkenness. \n\nLet’s see what Paul said are some...\n\n\n# 2. Things Christian ladies are to be:\nI see three things here—three words we don’t use very often—that Paul said should describe Christian ladies.  These three things should be all Christian ladies, not just older or younger Christian ladies.  \n\nThe first word that should describe Christian ladies is...\n\n## A. Sober\nIt says *”that they may teach the young women to be sober.”*\n\nNow, “sober” in the Bible does not mean the same thing that “sober” means today.  Today, “sober” means “not drunk,” but that is actually not the meaning it had in the Bible at all.\n\nIn the Bible, the word sober means two things:\n\nFirst, being “sober” means you are **“sound-minded.”**  It means you are sensible.  It means you aren’t crazy.\n\nWe live in a crazy world, and we have a lot of crazy pressures to deal with.  Ladies, moms, you have to deal with a lot.  There are always things to be afraid of.  There are always things to get “stressed out” over, and if you’re not careful, your life can just be overrun with stress and anxiety.  It can get out of control.\n\nThere were 46 million prescriptions to Xanax (a drug for anxiety) written out in just one year.  That’s one out of every six people in the U.S.. I’m not against anxiety medication, but doesn’t that say something about the world we live in?   People are stressed out. People are running around like crazy.  People are anxious.\n\nHow many of you know a mom (maybe it’s you) who is always running around like her hair is on fire?  She is stressed to the max and anxious about everything.\n\nThat’s the opposite of sober.  Sober means “sound-minded.”\n\nBut it’s when you look at the second meaning of this word “sober” that you really understand what is going on here.\n\nThe second idea in the word “sober” here is to be **disciplined**.  \n\nSo sober means “not stressed out, not anxious, sound-minded,” and on the flip side, it means “disciplined.”\n\nCan I humbly suggest that the way to not be stressed out and anxious is to be disciplined?\n\nA sober lady is a lady who disciplines herself so she isn’t stressed out all the time, so she isn’t running around with her hair on fire, and so she can be sound-minded.\n\nLet me just say something here before I move on. I’m not a lady (obviously),  but I’m susceptible to running around with stress and anxiety tearing me apart, too.  Men are also commanded to be sober.\n\nOne thing I’m learning (kind of the hard way) is that older people have a lot of tricks for fighting off the craziness of life, and we need to listen to them and learn from them.  \n\nAdulting is hard.  Raising kids is hard.  You can learn a lot from godly older people about just the rhythms of life: Waking up early; not letting your smartphone rule your life; having a quiet time every day where you read and study the scriptures; not procrastinating about little chores until they become giant balls of stress.  You older ladies have a lot to teach my generation about being sober.\n\nSo we need ladies to be sober—not stressed out and anxious, but disciplined.\n\nThe second word Paul says Christian ladies need to be is...\n\n## B. Discreet\n\nThe word for discreet is very close to the word for sober, and the meaning is very close.  I guess one of them refers to your mindset, whereas the other refers to your actions.\n\nDiscreet basically means “careful in your actions.”  \n\nWe need Christian ladies and Christian moms who are discreet and careful in what they do, what they say, and what they wear.\n\nLadies, be careful in **what you do**.  Just because something isn’t sinful doesn’t mean that it’s appropriate.  It doesn’t mean that it won’t have bad consequences later.  Think about the consequences.\n\nBe careful about**what you say**.  One of the marks of wisdom is having something between your mind and your mouth that stops something up here from coming out down here.  This applies to what you post on Facebook and Instagram, too.  Be careful what you say.\n\nI think discretion includes being careful about **what you wear**.  I think we can make too much of this, but the Bible is very clear that ladies need to put thought into dressing in a modest way.  Our older ladies need to be teaching our younger ladies Bible principles about this.  It’s an important part of discretion.\n\nSo... \n* Be sober - disciplined, not anxious.\n* Be discreet - careful in what you do, say or wear\n\nAnd the third thing Christian ladies need to be is they need to be...\n\n## C. Chaste\n\nThere’s a word you never hear anymore: Chaste.  \n\n“Chaste” simply means “pure”—pure in your thoughts and pure in your actions.  Christian ladies should be known for their moral purity.\n\nThat starts up here.  That starts with the shows you watch and the books you read.  It starts with the friends you listen to.  It starts by getting in the word of God every day.  Everything else is way downstream of that.\n\nWe need a bunch of ladies in our culture that are sober, discreet, and chaste.\n\nThat matches our doctrine.  That matches holiness, like peanut butter and jelly; like summer and sandals; like Moon Pies and RC Cola.  Some things just go together, and these mindsets go with being a Christian lady and a Christian mother.\n\nSo we’ve talked about things Christian ladies are to avoid and things Christian ladies are to be.\n\nLet me quickly give you...\n\n# 3. Things Christian ladies are to do:\nPaul gives us four things here for Christian ladies to do.  Some of these are really unpopular, but don’t get mad at me.  Get mad at the Bible.  \n\nThe first thing is...\n\n## A. Teach\n\nIt says to the older ladies *that they teach the young women.*  \n\nLet me tell you: The things I’m preaching this morning, I’m not the best person to be preaching them.  Far from it—the best person to be preaching them are Christian ladies who are further along in life, and Christian ladies who are younger need to listen.\n\nWe live in such an arrogant age.  Young people think they know everything.  We think we are so wise.  We think we are God’s gift to the human race sometimes.  There are these huge generation gaps that are culture just tries to make bigger and bigger.\n\nThey shouldn’t be in the church.  The church should be a place where the older ladies are teaching the younger ladies, and where the younger ladies are actively trying to learn from the older ladies.\n\nChristian ladies should be teaching and should be learning from each other.\n\nLadies, that means you shouldn’t just hang out with ladies who are your own age.  You should seek to spend time with some of the ladies who are twenty or thirty years older than you.  On the flip side, some of you ladies in your sixties or seventies need to have some ladies over who are in their twenties and thirties and spend some time with them.\n\nThere should be teaching and learning.\n\nThe second thing Christian ladies are to do is to...\n\n## B. Love\n\nIt says that the older ladies are to teach the younger ladies *”to love their husbands, to love their children.”*\n\nNotice this is something that you are to **learn.** It doesn’t just happen.  It’s an action.  It’s something you have to **do.**\n\nSometimes it’s really hard to love a man who is selfish, who is a klutz, or who is difficult.  Sometimes it’s hard to love children who won’t do their homework, won’t clean their room, or are fighting with their brothers and sisters. \n\nBut if Momma doesn’t do it, home is going to be a very, very dark and harsh place.\n\nThis may come as a shock to you, but I’m not easy to love.  My kids aren’t easy to love.  I’m so grateful that my wife works at it.\n\nThe Bible teaches that the husband is the head of the home.  That’s an unpopular teaching, but it’s still a biblical one.  But I think if the husband is the head of the home, the wife is the heart of the home.\n\nSo you have to love.  If you have a husband at home, you have to love him even when it’s work.  If you have kids, you have to love them even when it’s work.\n\nTeach (or learn) love.  The third thing it says for ladies to do is to...\n\n## C. Keep\n\nIt says *”to be keepers at home.”*\n\nWhen I was a kid and I’d read this verse, I thought this meant that ladies were not supposed to leave the house.  That’s silly.  Obviously that’s not what this means.\n\nI’ve researched this phrase and it means two things:\n\nIt means you as Christian ladies need to guard your home.  Watch over it.  Protect it, but not in the Glock or Sig Sauer sense.  We aren’t talking about you shooting people here, but just know what is going on there and work to keep bad stuff out of your house.\n\nBut the other sense—I think the main sense—is that Christian ladies need to take responsibility over making their house a home.  Work at making your house the kind of place you want to come home to.  Work at making it the kind of place where you are happy to be.\n\nI do not believe that God is against ladies working outside of the home.  The virtuous woman in Proverbs 31 did a lot of commerce in that chapter.  God used a lot of working ladies in the early church (like Lydia the seller of purple). But I do think that your house, ladies, is your domain. It’s your special place of service, and if you work at it, it can be a wonderful part of a godly Christian family.\n\nMake your home a special place—Not an expensive place; not a fancy place;  not a perfect place, but a special place.  Make it a place you want to come back to.  \n\nThe Bible mentions so many ladies in the early church whom God used because they opened their homes.   Ladies, your home can be a powerful launching pad; it can be a base; it can be a little slice of heaven in a hellish world, but you have to work at it.\n\nSo teach, love, keep, and one more thing here...\n\n## D. Submit\n\nNow this is a really, really unpopular teaching, but the Bible teaches that if your behavior is going to match your profession, and if your behavior is going to match your doctrine, then you need to order your home the way God intended.\n\nThis doesn’t mean, as feminists would tell us, that women are less important than men or are somehow lesser creatures.  That’s ludicrous.  I don’t think anyone could read the New Testament and come to that conclusion.  What it does mean is that God has ordained a certain order in the home, and godly ladies can do a great deal of good in this world by rejecting the world’s notions and embracing what the Bible says about how your home should be run.\n\n# Conclusion\nLet me make one more point and I’ll wrap this up: The world is watching us.  They aren’t watching us in church.  They could care less what we do in church.  They are watching the way we live our lives.\n\nI have always believed that one of the most powerful tools we have is having truly Christian homes.  True Christian homes are a purple cow in the world today.  They are remarkable.  People have to talk about them.\n\nLadies, you can do a world of good by making sure your lifestyle matches your teaching.  \n\nMoms and ladies, thank you for your sacrifice.  I wouldn’t be here today were it not for a godly mom:\n\n* A mom who made me go to church.  \n* A mom who sacrificed and worked a second job as a janitor and as a bus driver so I could go to a Christian school.  \n* A mom who I saw many times sitting in her armchair with her Bible and a cup of tea.\n* A mom who worked hard to make our house a home.  \n* A mom I still look to for advice and I still get excited about coming home to.\n\nAnd I’m so grateful that my kids have a godly mom.  I love you, Amanda.  \n\nLadies, there is an old saying that the hand that rocks the cradle rocks the world.  You can have such a huge impact for God.\n\nLet’s stand for invitation with heads bowed and eyes closed.\n\n1. Do you have a profession, have you trusted Christ as you savior?\n2. Do you match?",

    "body": "I think everyone here would say that they believe the Bible is God’s Word, but what is your attitude toward it? How important is it to you? Do you view the Bible as something to be read? As something to be obeyed? Why are you here at church today? Is it because you want to hear the Lord speak to you? What do you plan on doing once He does? That’s the idea James tackles in this portion of Scripture. You may answer in the affirmative to all the questions I just posed, but just saying so isn’t enough. We’ve got to prove it and back it up with the way we live. Even being at church and hearing the Bible preached by itself isn’t enough. It’s good that you’re here because hearing is the first step. “Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,” after all, but it’s not the only step. Let’s see what the Bible has to say today. \n\n[Read James 1:21-25]\n\nJames is a practical book written by a practical man. He believed in showing more than telling. In perhaps the most famous portion of this book in chapter 2, James says, “Don’t just tell me you have faith. Show it to me.” He’s saying much the same thing here in this passage. “Don’t just listen to God’s Word. Obey it.” So listen to what I have to say tonight, not because I’m saying it, but because I’m conveying the truth of the Bible to you, but don’t stop there. Listen with the intention of obeying what you hear. Ask the Lord to point things out to you that you need to obey, and He will. \n\nWhen God called Samuel, his response was, “Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.” That word “heareth” in the Hebrew means “Listening with a view to obeying.” In other words, Samuel had already committed to obeying whatever the Lord told him to do before He had even said anything to him. That’s the attitude God wants us to have toward the Bible. Will you do that today? \n\nI believe James presents to us three right responses to God’s Word, and they go in order. \n\nI. Receive God’s Word (1:21) – This is where it has to start for anyone. In verse 21, he says, “…receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.” That word “engrafted” also has the idea of “implanted.” It reminds me of the parable of the sower that we studied in Sunday School a month or so ago. There were four types of soil that represented four kinds of hearts. The first type utterly rejected God’s Word altogether. With the second and the third types, the seed broke the soil, but they never let it take root and bear fruit. Other things in the soil crowded it and choked it out. It was only the good ground that received the seed and bore fruit. I believe both the parable and this passage here are referring primarily to receiving God’s Word for salvation, but even after we’re saved, we don’t always allow His Word to have its proper place in our lives. What is distracting you and preventing you from trusting and obeying the Lord the way that you should?\n\nIn order to receive God’s Word properly, we have to remove some things. James says we need to lay these things apart as we receive the Word. Repentance and faith go hand in hand. In Acts 20:21, Paul summed up the core of his message as “repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” As we are turning to God, we are simultaneously turning away from sin. In I Thessalonians 1:9, Paul said that they turned to God from idols. \n\nHere, James mentions two things that we need to lay apart in order to be saved. The first is “filthiness,” which refers to general immorality and impurity. Sin makes us filthy before God, and the blood of Jesus Christ is the only thing that can make us clean. He will do just that if we’ll come to Him and confess our sins, as I John 1:9 tells us. The second is “superfluity of naughtiness,” which is an unusual phrase, to say the least. It’s not something you’ll hear someone drop into casual conversation. What does it mean? “Superfluity” means an overabundance or a surplus of something. “Naughtiness” here specifically refers to malice, spite, and ill intent toward others. \n\nAs I was studying what these words meant, I discovered that the Greek word for “superfluity” was also what they would use to describe excess buildup of ear wax. That’s something I can relate to on a personal level [Tell story of having to get ears flushed out because of wax buildup]. The point is that sin stops up our ears and prevents us from hearing God speaking to us clearly. Sometimes we wonder why we can’t hear Him speaking to us as if it’s His fault when our ears aren’t open. If we really want to know what God’s Word says and what it means for us, then we’re going to have to clean out our ears. What is getting in the way of your relationship with Jesus Christ? \n\nJames also says we have to receive the word with meekness. We have to lay aside any notion of earning righteousness through our own effort. We must humble ourselves before God and admit that we can’t save ourselves. Only Jesus Christ can save us. Pride is one of the biggest reasons people don’t get saved. They can’t bring themselves to admit that they need the Lord for one reason or another. Perhaps they’ve made a profession of faith early in life or perhaps they’ve got a good reputation in the church, so they’re afraid of what others will think if they come forward and confess that they’re lost, contrary to what others have been led to believe. \n\nMaybe you’re here today and that’s you. There are good people who’ve been going to good churches for a long time, and they’ve struggled with doubt over their salvation, but they can’t bring themselves to confront it or come forward publicly about it. Let me tell you that your pride and the opinions of others aren’t worth going to hell over, and the church will rejoice with you for getting genuinely saved or for getting assurance of your salvation. You don’t have to worry or be afraid about that. \n\nII. Obey God’s Word (1:22-24) – I think this part is the key to the entire passage. James tells his audience to be doers of the word and not hearers only, and he warns them not to deceive themselves. In other words, “Don’t trick yourself into believing that simply listening alone is enough. There’s more to it than that.” That word “deceive” can also mean “cheat,” so he’s also saying not to cheat yourselves by thinking hearing alone is sufficient. \n\nCheat yourselves out of what? Look at the end of verse 25: “…He being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.” James is essentially telling us not to cheat ourselves out of God’s blessing. Obedience is the key that opens the door to His blessings in our lives. Your life will just be better if you obey God, as well as scriptural authority by extension. \n\nI sometimes try to get this lesson across to kids, usually unsuccessfully: The sooner you learn to obey your parents and those in authority over you right away, the better off you’ll be. Your relationship with your parents will be better. You won’t have to worry about getting into trouble so much. You have so much more freedom and you’ll have so much more fun than you ever will in your perceived sense of freedom and fun when you rebel. That lesson is true for adults, too, when it comes to God-given authority, which ultimately derives from the Bible.\n\nJesus issues a similar warning at the end of the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 7. Turn with me there, and let’s look at verses 24-27. Both of them heard. The difference was that only one of them was both a hearer and a doer. The Sermon on the Mount is considered by many to be the greatest message ever preached, but even then, Jesus is saying, “Just hearing it isn’t enough.” You could be sitting in church and listen to the greatest sermon you’ve ever heard in your life (which probably isn’t going to happen right now), but it isn’t going to do you any good unless you put what you hear into practice. \n\nThen James drives the point home by making an illustration about a man looking in a mirror. The Greek word here is literally “male.” Oftentimes in Scripture, “man” can refer to mankind in general, but it’s referring specifically to men here. After all, looking into a mirror and failing to correct what you see is definitely male behavior. It’s not something you’ll see a woman do. Women tend to be meticulous and take their time in front of the mirror. Men will take a quick glance, say “Eh, good enough,” and be on their way. I’m sure my mom can attest that there were probably many times I nearly left the house with my hair sticking up everywhere, and she had to send me back into the bathroom to fix it. It happened this morning, in fact! I’m kidding, I’m kidding…or am I?\n\nEven worse, some will look into the mirror merely to admire themselves with no intention to fix anything. They ignore their flaws and revel in their perceived strengths. We shouldn’t be spiritual narcissists, but we can get that way when we only hear without the intention of doing. We can get a false sense of ourselves when we think we’re doing good enough, or at least we’re doing better than someone else is. Critical self-examination is often unpleasant, which is why a lot of people don’t want to do it. \n\nThe point that James is trying to make here is that God’s Word is like a mirror. It’s going to point out some flaws, and you can either choose to fix them or just let them be. Just as it would be foolish for me to look in a mirror and see that my hair is sticking up, I missed a spot shaving, and I’ve got food stuck in my teeth, but I make no effort to fix it, it would be even more foolish for us to look into the mirror of the Bible as it points out our sins and shortcomings and say, “Eh, good enough. I’m fine.” \n\nPersonally, I always feel awkward when I notice that someone has food in their teeth or something hanging out of their nose, and while I know I should say something to them, I’m usually a little hesitant to do so, especially if I don’t know them that well. If I could just stick a mirror in front of their face, that would be a lot easier. That’s the beauty of preaching the Word of God. I can just hold up the mirror of the Bible in front of you and let it do the work. I don’t have to be afraid of pointing something out because I’ve got God’s Word to back me up on it. \n\nThere’s actually another place in the New Testament that uses a mirror as an illustration. Turn with me to II Corinthians 3, and let’s look at verse 18. “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” This is the effect a mirror should have on us. After we’ve looked into the mirror, there should be change. That word “change” is the same Greek word where we get the word “metamorphosis” from. Give a woman enough time in front of a mirror, and there will be a transformation. Men, not so much, but the Bible should change our attitudes and our actions. Don’t be content with just coming to church and hearing a sermon. Determine to let God’s Word change you.\n\nIII. Continue in the Word (1:25) – Being a doer of the Word isn’t just something we do one time or for a little while. It should be a regular practice. Many Christians struggle with being consistent in their spiritual lives. They’re in and out, up and down. The Christian life shouldn’t be a roller coaster where you’re flip-flopping back and forth between highs and lows. It should be more like a steady rise.\n\nYou can still be growing in strength spiritually even when you’re at a very low moment physically or emotionally. The Apostle Paul talks about this in II Corinthians 12 when he was suffering from his thorn in the flesh. He prayed for the Lord to get rid of it three times to no avail, but He assured Paul that, “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” That was enough for Paul because he goes on to say, “Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.” That is an amazing statement of faith. I’m not there yet. I can’t say that I delight in my difficulties because it means I’ll experience God’s sufficient and strengthening grace. \n\nOur goal as Christians should be consistent spiritual growth, and that will only happen if we continue in God’s Word, not just in hearing and reading it, but in obeying it. The Lord promises to bless us if we do. That word “looketh” in verse 25 speaks of a penetrating stare, not just a passing glance. We need to spend time daily looking into God’s Word and responding to what we find. \n\nSo what stage are you on? Have you received God’s Word for salvation? If you haven’t, don’t put that off. Paul said that today is the day of salvation. Are you still only listening? I pray you’ll recognize that’s not good enough, and you’ll decide to move beyond that. Maybe you want to be a doer of the word and you’re trying to, but you’re struggling with consistency. Pray and seek after God’s sufficient grace. Maybe you used to be a doer, but you aren’t being one right now. I hope you’ll change your mind about that. \n\nCharles Spurgeon used to say that the sermon doesn’t begin until the application begins, and I feel that’s particularly appropriate for today’s message. If you’ve decided that you want to be someone who continues in God’s Word, don’t wait. We’re going to have an invitation in just a second, and during that time, you can either come to the altar or pray at your seat, but commit to obeying His Word and ask Him to help you. ",

    "body": "# James 2:1-9 - Don’t Discriminate\n\nOpening Illustration: Gordon MacDonald coming to church.\n\nOur text tonight is going to be James 2:1-9.  Let’s go ahead and turn there, and get started by reading it.\n\n> *”1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, [the Lord] of glory, with respect of persons. 2 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment; 3 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool: 4 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts? 5 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him? 6 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats? 7 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called? 8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.”*\n\nLast week, I preached about phony religion from the end of James 1.  Remember that James gives us three acid tests for phony religion—three ways you can spot real religion.   They are: \n\n* Keeping your tongue under control.\n* Looking out for the poor and destitute.\n* Staying away from worldliness.\n\nWhat I didn’t tell you last week is that these are themes.  Often, when I preach, at the beginning of the message, I’ll give you my outline, and then pray and preach through the outline.  The old public speaking advice is, \n\n> Tell them what you are going to say, tell them, and then tell them what you said.\n\nAt the end of James 1, that is kind of what James is doing.  He is giving us an outline.  He’s telling us subjects he’s going to be covering in the rest of the book.  Tonight, we are looking again at the middle subject: How we treat the poor and destitute.\n\nHere are the three things we are going to cover tonight:\n\n* First, there is a command against being a “respecter of persons”.\n* Second, there is an illustration of that command.\n* Third, there are four reasons for this command.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll get right into that.**\n\nLet’s start tonight with...\n\n## 1. The command.\nVerse 1 says:\n\n> *”My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.”*\n\nJames is saying here, “Don’t be a respecter of persons.“ Being a respecter of persons and being a Christian don’t mix.  \n\nSo what does it mean to be a “respecter of persons?”  This is a phrase that is used several times in the Bible.  It’s actually one very long Greek word (13 letters) that I wouldn’t dare try to pronounce, but it comes up many times in the Bible.\n\nBasically, what it means is discrimination or favoritism.  What James is saying here is don’t discriminate against people who are worse off than you and don’t show favoritism towards those who are better off than you.\n\nIf you were to do a Bible study of this word and look at how it’s used, you’d learn two things:\n\n**First, God isn’t a respecter of persons.  God doesn’t discriminate.  You see this all over the scripture.  For example…**\n\nRomans 2:11 says:\n\n> *”For there is no respect of persons with God.”*\n\nThat verse is talking about salvation and mentioning Jews and Gentiles.  \n\nEphesians 6:9 says:\n\n> *”And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.”*\n\nAgain, God isn’t a respecter of persons.  It’s talking about status here.  Employee/employer or master/servant.  God doesn’t care.  God doesn’t discriminate. He isn’t partial. He doesn’t show favoritism.  \n\nI saw a sign at Cracker Barrel the other day that said, “My family is God’s favorite sitcom.”  I got a kick out of that.\n\nThe truth is that God doesn’t have favorites, and He doesn’t show favorites.  God isn’t prejudiced.  God sees fairly.\n\nAren’t you glad for that?  Aren’t you glad that God doesn’t say, “You know what? I like the Jews more.  I’m going to give them preferential treatment.”  Or “You know what? I like left-handed redheads more, so I’m only going to save left-handed redheads.”  \n\nGod doesn’t show favoritism.  God isn’t partial.  He isn’t a respecter of persons.\n\nGod reminds us of this for two reasons:  First, because He wants us to know that His mercy and grace are available to anyone. Second, because He doesn’t want us to think we have some special claim that other people don’t have.\n\nThe second thing you would learn if you were to do a word study on the word “respect of persons” is **there are basically three ways we tend to be respecters of persons:**\n\nThe first way is **racially** or **nationally**.  Sometimes our tendency is to like people from one country more than people from another country, or to show favoritism of one race over another.\n\nIf you are brutally honest with yourself, you’ll see that you do this.  Everyone does this.  Red and yellow, black and white—all of us show favoritism on racial grounds, but God doesn’t.   God doesn’t like white Americans any more or less than black Americans, people from India, or people from Iran.  God doesn’t respect one nation or race over another.\n\nIn the eyes of God, the Mexican working in the restaurant is just as much a beloved child as you are.  The black kids playing in the street are just as favored as your kids.  The Indians you have to talk to on tech support calls are on level footing with you.\n\nBut our human nature doesn’t want to see it that way.\n\nSo there is racial discrimination.\n\nThe second way you see “respect of persons” used is in **status**—things like employee and employer, master and servant, man and woman.  There are different roles and positions in life, and sometimes our human thought is to show favoritism to people higher up on the social ladder than others.  If a senator and a dishwasher were in a room together, you’d probably treat one better than the other.\n\nSome of that is okay.  Some of that is giving honor to whom honor is due.  God isn’t against that kind of thing, but it gets dangerous when we think that because of status, you have a different set of rules in the eyes of God; that God will cut the pastor some slack because he’s a pastor; that the boss can get away with things in God’s eyes that the workers cannot.  It doesn’t work that way.  In God’s eyes, it’s actually the opposite.  The higher you are lifted up, the greater you’ll come under the condemnation of God.\n\nSo there is status respect of persons and racial respect of persons.  The third kind of respect of persons is **economic**: Respecting rich people more than poor people.\n\nApparently, in the churches James was writing to, there was a big problem with this because he spends a lot of time here dealing with it.  \n\nLet’s look at the second point tonight...\n\n## 2. The illustration.\n\nIn verses 2-4, James gives us a hypothetical situation as an illustration.  He tells us to imagine a church service where you have two visitors.  One of them is very rich.  He’s wearing a tailored suit, an expensive watch, and large expensive rings on his fingers.  He pulls up to the church parking lot in a top of the line BMW 7 series.  The guy is just oozing with class and obviously very wealthy and important, so the ushers see him and they clear out the best seat in the house for him to sit. People gladly and deferentially move out of their seat for him so that he can be comfortable in church.\n\nThen the second guy comes in.  He stinks.  He has bad teeth.  His clothes are all battered, ripped, and filthy.  It’s obvious this guy is either homeless or very close to being homeless.  Maybe he smells like cigarette smoke.  When he comes into the service, no one moves over for him.  No one wants to sit next to him.  Maybe the moms lean over to their kids and whisper, “Honey, stay with me during handshaking time.”  The ushers don’t try hard to find him a seat, and he gets the worst seat in the house.  He actually ends up having to stand in the back.\n\nAfter the service, everyone wants to shake the rich guy’s hand and welcome him to the church.  No one says a word to the poor guy.  He waits around awkwardly for a minute and then slinks out the back door.\n\nThat’s the picture James is painting for us here.  Now be honest.  Be brutally honest with yourself.  It could happen here.   You know it.  I know it.  We can talk a big game, but the proof is in the pudding.  I can absolutely see that sort of thing happen in our church on a Sunday morning.\n\nWe fall under James’ condemnation here just like the people he was originally writing to.  It’s a powerful illustration.\n\nWe are respecters of persons.\n\nAnd James is saying to stop it.  It’s bad.  It doesn’t fit our Christian profession.  It doesn’t go with *the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.*  When we have “respect of persons,” there is a disconnect between what we are saying we believe and how we act.\n\nSo we’ve seen the command: Don’t respect persons. We’ve seen the illustration.  Let’s look at the third point...\n\n## 3. The reasons.\n\nJames gives four reasons why we shouldn’t have respect of persons.\n\nThe first is...\n\n### A. It shows your evil thoughts.\n\nVerse 4 says:\n\n> *”Are ye not partial within yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?”*\n\nI always thought this meant that we are judging the thoughts of other people, but studying this out, that’s not what that phrase means at all.  The word “of” can describe what we are judging, but it can also mean “who have” or “described by.”\n\nActually, the word “of” isn’t in the Greek at all.  It’s just “judges evil thoughts.”  Personally, I think what James is saying here—and it makes a lot more sense—is that when you show respect of persons, you are becoming a judge and showing your evil thoughts.  You are showing your partiality.\n\nMaybe you want to look good to the rich guy.  Maybe you think the rich guy can help you somehow.  What James is saying is that there is some ulterior motive behind this.  Your selfishness is on display.\n\nNow, I don’t know about you, but I know what goes on in my heart, and I have to guard against this because I’m guilty here, folks. I might not act on it, but I want to.  Rich people can move me along.  Rich people can help make me successful.  Rich members can help us build a bigger building, increase our offerings, and so on.\n\nI’m just telling you the kind of things that go through my head.  It’s not good.  We have to fight against that.\n\nThe second reason James gives for why we shouldn’t discriminate is...\n\n### B. It’s usually poor people who are true believers.\n\nThe verse says *”Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?”*\n\nThis is an interesting verse, because in the middle of saying that we shouldn’t be partial to the rich, it’s telling us that God is kind of partial to the poor.  At least it’s poor people who generally have an easier time trusting Christ and truly believing.\n\nJesus said, *”For where your treasure is their will your heart be also.”* He said that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to come to faith in Christ.\n\nThis is because rich people tend to be all set. They tend feel like they are on top of the world, and because they have so much to lose, faith is difficult for them.  \n\nBut poor people, by contrast, sometimes have only their faith.  \n\nWhat I’m saying is that faith comes easier for poorer people.  Jesus said, *”Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.”* (Matthew 5:3).  It’s easier to be “poor in spirit” when you aren’t rich in this world’s goods.\n\nSo if that’s true, why be partial to rich people?  If poor people tend to be the ones who get it—if they tend to be the ones who trust Christ—then why cater and bow to the rich folks?\n\nSo James was saying that when you are partial to rich folks, you are showing your evil thoughts, and you are going against who God is for.  I’ve got two more points here and where are done.  The third thing James said was...\n\n### C. You are lifting up the people who are putting you down.\n\nVerses 6-7 say:\n\n> *”But ye have despised the poor.  Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats?  Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called?”*\n\nRemember that this letter was written to the early Jewish Christians in and around Jerusalem.   We know from the rest of the New Testament that these Christians had a really hard time.  They were severely oppressed and persecuted by the Jews.\n\nApparently, the rich pharisaical Jews would use the courts and economic pressure as a way to persecute the Christians.  \n\nSo these Christians were showing favoritism to the very people who were putting them down.  It doesn’t make any sense.\n\nOne more reason James gives against partiality, and it’s a big one.\n\n### D. You are breaking the “royal law.”\n\nLook at verse 8:\n\n> *”If ye fulfill he royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well: but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors.”*\n\nThis is James last advice to us here: Love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nWhenever I read that phrase, it reminds me of the man who came to Jesus and asked him what the greatest commandment in the law was. Jesus said, “Love the lord your God with all your heart and soul and mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\nAnd do you remember the man’s follow up question?  He asked, “Well, who is my neighbor? Who am I to look out for?”\n\nThen Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan.  The point of the Good Samaritan was that we shouldn’t be asking, “Who is my neighbor?” but “How can I be a good neighbor?” and “Who can I be a good neighbor to?”  We shouldn’t be asking, “Who do I *have* to help?” but “Who can I help?” \n\nJames calls this “the royal law.”  \n\nYou see, most of us are looking at this thing all wrong.  Most of us are trying to surround ourselves with people who are important, because we think **they will help us** when what we should be doing is trying to find people **we can help and love.**  \n\nIsn’t that what Jesus did?  Jesus didn’t surround himself with the uppity-ups.  Jesus didn’t have an entourage of celebrities.  He chose fisherman and publicans to be His disciples.  He spent time with the sick, with the destitute, with the lepers, with the sinners.\n\nHe looked for people to love, and He took that love all the way to the cross.  I wasn’t Jesus’ neighbor, but Jesus was a neighbor to me.  Compared to Jesus, I was the most beggarly of beggars. He was the King of kings and Lord of lords and I’m a nothing, and yet He didn’t just pay my way at an inn; He went to the cross for me. \n\nNow, we as believers all have that testimony.  All of us are saved by grace.  All of us are wretches who have been touched by the grace of God.  We are all like Annie—poor orphans living by grace in the house of Daddy Warbucks—only we are a lot worse off than Annie, and our Heavenly Father is both nicer and richer than Daddy Warbucks.  Oh, and to make it all happen, our Heavenly Father had to send His only begotten Son to die.\n\nSo with that as our example and as the foundation of our life, shouldn’t we look for people to show the royal law to?  Shouldn’t we be people who love our neighbor as ourself?\n\nShouldn’t we be looking for people to love, rather than looking to put people down?  ",

    "body": "Don’t Miss Out\nHaggai 2:1-9\n\nI think it’s important to provide some background before we dive into the message itself because Haggai isn’t a well-known book, and the context is important to understanding what the prophet is saying to the Jews. This book is written after the Jews have returned from their 70-year exile in Babylon, and they’re trying to settle in to their new life, but it doesn’t come without its problems. They attempt to rebuild the city and rebuild the temple, but their enemies in the surrounding cities protest to the Persian government and get all the work shut down. \n\nSo now the Jews are living in a city that’s still in ruins with a half-finished temple, and they’re understandably discouraged. Life in Israel just isn’t what it used to be. They’re not as big, not as populous, not as wealthy, not as powerful as they once were. They’re struggling through this adjustment period to find a “new normal,” and that’s where Haggai comes in. In chapter 1, he urges the people to pick themselves up, dust themselves off, get their priorities in order, and finish the temple, and the Jews actually listen to a prophet for a change because that’s exactly what they do. If chapter 1 focuses on the macro, then chapter 2 focuses on the micro, as Haggai instructs the Jews on how to live for God daily in a new environment, which they’re still struggling with for various reasons. \n\nThere are three lessons that Haggai teaches the Jews in this passage here. I did not come up with this outline myself. I’ve been listening to Bro. Scott Pauley’s podcast (which I highly recommend to you if you don’t listen to it; he does 10 minute episodes 5 days a week on various subjects in the Bible), and he did a mini-series on the book of Haggai. The points he made here really stuck out to me, and I wanted to share them with you tonight.\n\n1. Don’t Miss the Present by Focusing on the Past (2:1-3)\n\nIn these verses, the older generation is lamenting over how ordinary this new temple is compared to how magnificent Solomon’s temple was. If you read the description of Solomon’s temple in I Kings 6 (or if you’ve seen illustrated representations of it), it’s an understandable reaction. It was covered in gold, and it was much bigger than this new temple was. To these older Jews, this temple represented the fact that life now isn’t as good as it used to be.\n\nSometimes we talk about the “good old days,” but I think our nostalgia tends to only focus on what we thought was good and we forget about the things that were bad. We shouldn’t talk about the “good old days” as if the best is behind us. We should be living in good days today and in the future. Now this doesn’t mean every day is a good day. We all struggle and have bad days, but it belittles what God is still doing in this world today when we only talk about what He did back then. The Lord still wants to do great things in this world, in this church, and in your life. We recently celebrated this church’s 50th anniversary, and I think our pastor had the right perspective on that. He said that we were remembering the past, but we were also looking to the future. Our church’s best days should be ahead of us, not behind us. \n\nSome people will quote II Timothy 3:13, “Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived” as if that means it’s becoming less and less possible to live for God and do great things for Him. But the very next verse says, “But continue thou in the things that thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them.” The fact that the world is getting worse should motivate us to do more for Christ, not less. It’s not an excuse to become complacent. It’s all the more reason we need to continue to be faithful and pressing forward for Him. The devil is fighting harder than ever, and so should we. \n\n2. Don’t Miss Who is For Us by Focusing on Who is Against Us (2:4-5)\n\nThis was a major problem the Jews were facing before Haggai arrived on the scene. They let their enemies beat them down into submission to the point that they just gave up on ever rebuilding the city and rebuilding the temple. They lost sight of who God is because they got so focused on their problems. It reminds me of one of my favorite Bible stories, which is the miracle of Jesus walking on the water. At one point, Peter asks Jesus to let him walk to Him on the water as well. As long as Peter kept his eyes on Jesus, he was able to do miraculous things. It was when he started noticing the wind and the waves around him that he began to sink. That’s why Hebrews 12:2 tells us we should be “looking unto Jesus.”\n\nThree times in verse 4 the Lord says, “Be strong.” He says it to Zerubbabel, the political leader; He says it to Joshua the high priest, the spiritual leader; and He says it to all the people. It doesn’t matter how bad our circumstances might be. God’s strength is always enough. Paul learned this lesson in II Corinthians 12, when he was dealing with a thorn in the flesh. He asked God three times to take it away from him because of all the pain and trouble it was causing him, and yet the Lord never did. In II Corinthians 12:9, Christ says, “My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” Paul’s response should be ours: “Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” It sounds like a paradox to say that His strength is greatest when we are at our weakest, but it’s only when we get to the point that we realize we can’t do it without Him that we start to see the greatness of His power in a real way. As long as we believe our own strength is sufficient to get us through, we’ll never know the true sufficiency of God’s strength and grace. \n\nWe also have a God whose word we can trust. In verse 5, He speaks of “the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt.” Ten different times in this chapter, God says, “I will.” That is a promise we can trust. If He says it, He will do it. This is one of the many reasons that it is important for us to read the Bible daily. There is so much comfort and encouragement to be gleaned from learning the promises that we find God’s Word. In a world filled with instability, there is great assurance in knowing we have a Word that will not change and cannot be undone. \n\nAt the end of verse 5, God also says, “So my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.” The indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit helps us to overcome fear in our lives. II Timothy 1:7 says, “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” Pastor Sexton used to say this all the time: “The fear of God casts out all lesser fears.” When we’re tempted to get focused on our problems rather than look to the Lord, we need to remember I John 4:4, which says, “Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”\n\n3. Don’t Miss the Spiritual by Focusing on the Material (2:6-9)\n\nGod talks about things that will be shaken and things that cannot be shaken. This is a contrast between the temporal and the eternal. Sometimes we can get so focused on things that don’t matter that we lose sight of what’s really important. We live in a world that is so obsessed with “stuff.” Now we should be thankful for what God has provided for us, but we have to remember that there’s more to life than how much stuff you have and how much money you make.\n\nOn the other hand, we have to avoid getting focused on what we don’t have that we forget what we do have in the Lord. Even if you were to lose everything tomorrow in terms of this world’s goods, you would still have everything you need because you still have the Lord and the Lord still has you. We have to be able to say, as Paul did in II Corinthians 3:5, “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.”\n\nWe must also avoid focusing on what others have that we don’t have as if we can’t do anything without whatever that thing is. That was the problem a lot of the Jews here were having. The older generation was discouraged about how small and plain this new temple was compared to the size and splendor of Solomon’s Temple. On a similar note, we are a smaller church, and we can be tempted to think that we can’t do as much as a big church. I don’t know who said it originally, but I’ve heard it many times: “A church is not measured by its size, but by its likeness to Jesus Christ.” When we stand before God, He isn’t going to be looking at church attendance records. When Jesus addressed the seven churches in Revelation, the church at Philadelphia was the smallest church of them all, but it received the highest commendation from the Lord, who had nothing negative to say about it.\n\nIt is important to understand that God is not restricted by numbers. In I Samuel 14, we read the story of Jonathan and his armorbearer taking on an entire garrison of the Philistines by themselves. Before the battle, Jonathan says in verse 6, “There is no restraint to the Lord to save by many or by few.” While these two Israelites were winning great victories, Saul and the rest of the army were just sitting around, twiddling their thumbs, and doing nothing. II Chronicles 14:11 says, “Lord, is it nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power.”\n\nThe Lord is still at work in this world, and we should make sure we don’t miss out on it by focusing on the wrong things. God assured these Jews that this smaller, lesser temple would enjoy greater glory than even Solomon’s temple, and the reason for this is given in verse 7, “And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts.” Who or what is the desire of all nations? He’s talking about Jesus Christ. This would be the temple that Jesus taught in and ministered in. Jesus is the fulfillment of everything every nation is looking for, even though they may not know it or acknowledge it. In Jesus Christ, we find salvation, love, joy, peace, satisfaction, forgiveness, acceptance, and many other things people the world over are searching for. \n\nWhere is your focus today? Are you focused on lesser things? Or are your eyes on Jesus Christ, where they ought to be?",

    "body": "# Ecclesiastes 10\nI’ve been reading this book over the last several weeks called “Twelve Rules For Life: An Andedote to Chaos” by a psychologist named Jordan Peterson.  Dr. Peterson is not a born again Christian, and there is a lot of stuff in the book that I don’t think born again Christians should swallow - but it’s mostly just common sense that is ridiculously uncommon and I’m glad I’m reading it.\n\n\nTonight we are going to look at chapter 9 (I’m skipping over most of chapter 8) and I want to give you **8 rules for life from Solomon.**\n\nNow, I’m skipping over most of chapter 8.  Chapter 9 is a lot of “under the sun” or life without God thinking and it’s pretty bleak.  Basically the best it can come up with is get all the gusto you can get.  Live for today because you aren’t promised a tomorrow type stuff.  It’s a goad to unbelievers because if you don’t believe in the afterlife and you insist on living life without God it’s all you get, pain, confusion and ultimately death.\n\nAt the end of chapter 8 Solomon starts to give us more wisdom for actually living a good life.  And that’s what this is tonight.  Not particularly spiritual.  Just 8 rules for living a good and fulfilling life.\n\nYou could be a Buddhist or a Muslim and these lessons would be just as true and just as valuable.  So it’s a different kind of message tonight.\n\n## 1. Little vices can make a big stink of your life. (8:18-9:1)\n\nThe ointment of the apothecary would be perfume.  If the guy who makes the perfume isn’t careful and a fly gets in there, it’s not going to smell good, it’s going to stink.\n\nMy pastor in Tennessee used to say to me:\n\n> Trifles make perfection and perfection is no trifle.\n\nThis is a reminder that we should work on the little things.  The big picture of our life is made up of a bunch of little tiny decisions.  It’s made up of moments and habits and it helps us immensely to get those habits and moments under control.\n\nBut that’s not the main lesson here.  The main lesson is:\n\n**It only takes a few minutes of sin to destroy a lifetime testimony of righteousness.**\n\nA person can be amazing.  They can be super competent and fun to be around and seem almost perfect and one small habit can cause their life to stink.  \n\nIf someone told you I have a pornography habit (I don’t by the way) but if I did I gaurentee you most of you wouldn’t be here next Sunday.  It doesn’t matter how good I am at preaching.  It doesn’t matter how well the church is run.  That’s a dead fly in the ointment.  \n\n## 2. Character is better than competence. (9:2)\n\nIn Bible times, the right hand was the position of strength and power.  It was the place of control.  The left hand was the place of uncertainty and no control.  \n\nSo the idea hear is that a wise man has his heart under control, he knows his heart.  But a foolish person’s heart isn’t under control and they are afraid of it.\n\nI think what this is talking about is being a person of character.  Being a person with a good heart.   Being someone who does right when no one is looking.\n\nThat’s wisdom.  And that is far better than being the competent person who doesn’t mind his heart - just his reputation.\n\n## 3. It’s better to stay silent and be thought a fool, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt. (3, 11-14, 20-21)\n\nYour words betray your heart.\n\n* A fool can’t hide himself.  He tells everyone that he is a fool by his words.  (3)\n\n> *”for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.”*  (Luke 6:45d)\n\n* A fool with an untamed mouth is as dangerous as a serpent.  (11)\n* A fool will destroy his own life with this own words. (12-13)\n* A fool can’t stop talking (14)\n* A fools words will get him in trouble with authority and hinder his advancement in life (20-21)\n\n\n## 4. Faithfulness will keep you out of a lot of trouble (4)\n\nThe idea here seems to be that even when you seem like you are in trouble, be faithful and don’t leave your post.  This will go a long way pacifying the people you are in trouble with.\n\nOur tendency when we are in trouble is to run away, to hide.  But that’s not what we should do, we should confront it.  We should fess up to it and keep doing what we are supposed to be doing and when we do that it goes a long way in the eyes of the person we are in trouble with.\n\n## 5. You reap what you sow. (8-9)\n\nDon’t go making trouble because the trouble might hurt you.\n\n## 6. Time spent sharpening your axe is not wasted time. (10)\n\nAbraham Lincoln once said that if he had two hours to cut down a tree, he’d spent the first hour and a half sharpening the axe.  \n\nOne of the best things you can do for yourself is to become a sharper axe.  Read.  Take care of your self.  Take classes.  Get degrees.  Teach yourself new skills.  These things make you a sharper axe.   They make you a more effective person.\n\nThis goes for the ministry too.  You can take classes.  You can learn new skills.  You can practice.  You can grow.\n\nIf your ministry is wearing you out maybe you need to sharpen the axe.  \n\n## 7. Everything rises and falls on leadership. (16-17)\n\n\n\n\n\n## 8. Laziness will ruin your life. (19)\n",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me again and turn to Ecclesiastes 2.  Ecclesiastes 2.  We are going to look at verses 1-10 tonight.  Let’s go ahead and read it.\n\n> *”1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also [is] vanity. 2 I said of laughter, [It is] mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 3 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what [was] that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life. 4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all [kind of] fruits: 6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: 7 I got [me] servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me: 8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, [as] musical instruments, and that of all sorts. 9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.”*\n\nRemember, Ecclesiastes is a book of goads and nails.  It is a book that forces us to deal with some heavy truths about life and it uses those heavy truths to push us to God.\n\nBut it’s also a great experiment.  \n\nYou know, one of the dumbest things that people ever say is “I’m going to do it myself, I’m going to live my own life, I’m going to make my own experiences.”\n\nA big part of wisdom is learning from other people’s experiences so you don’t have to go through it yourself.\n\nListen, I’d rather learn from the experience of a person who jumped off a cliff than get that experience myself.  There are a lot of experiences I’d rather borrow than live out myself.\n\nEcclesiastes is a book of borrowed experience.  Solomon has made it to the top in every worldly way and he’s giving us an honest look at it so we can learn from his experience, so we can learn what things are worth living for and what things aren’t.  \n\nLook at verse 1 with me:\n\n> *”I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.”*\n\nThis verse sets up this whole section. Solomon is telling us something he is going to try to find satisfaction in.  In this case, he’s telling us that he is going to try to find satisfaction in **pleasure**.\n\nSo the first point tonight is simple.  It is… \n\n## 1. The emptiness of pleasure. \n\nSolomon tells us in verse 1 the end result.  He tells us that seeking meaning in pleasure is “vanity” it is empty.  It is hollow.\n\nBut he goes into a lot of detail in how he himself lived for pleasure in verses 2-8.\n\nThe first thing Solomon tried was the pleasure of…\n\n### Laughs (2)\n\nLook at verse 2:\n\n> *”I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?”*\n\nIf you turn on your TV, one of the biggest things out there is comedy.  I mean, you’ve got Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert and those are just the big time guys.  There are dozens of other guys and whole channels devoted to comedy.  You’ve got stand up and sit coms and comedy movies. You can spend all day on Youtube or on Netflix just watching comedy videos.\n\nI have to admit - I like to watch comedy videos sometimes.  I like to laugh.  \n\nSolomon decided he was going to live for laughs.  He was going to get all the chuckles he could get and his conclusion was that it is pointless.  That it is mad.\n\nSo the next thing Solomon tried was…\n\n### Alchohol (3)\n\nSolomon tried booze.  Look at verse 3:\n\n> *”I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine,”*\n\nA lot of people are living for booze.  They are living drink to drink.  They can’t make it without a little drink “to take the edge off.”\n\nSolomon himself should have known better.  He is the one who wrote Proverbs 20:1\n\n> *”Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.”*\n\nIt never ceases to amaze me how many people I meet in life who cannot imagine having a good time without booze being involved.  Really.  \n\nI’ve been to several Chamber of Commerce get togethers here in town and every single one of them, every one, has to involve alcohol.  It’s like you can’t just go and meet people and talk without booze being involved?\n\nBut it ruins lives.  It deceives people.  I wrecks marriages.  It puts kids in the hospital or in an early grave.  It sends people to the gutter.\n\nYou can have a lot of fun and not be a drinker.  You can enjoy life and not be a drinker.  You can have great conversations and not be a drinker.\n\nSo Solomon chased laughter and alcohol, then he picked it up and chased…\n\n### A beautiful house (4-6)\n\nLook at verses 4-6\n\n> *”I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: 6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:”*\n\nSolomon didn’t just have a nice house - he had the nicest house in the world.  He had his own vineyards and gardens and orchards.  He had his own olympic swimming pools and ornate fountains and ponds.  He had his own parks and ornate gardens.\n\nSolomon was a lot like Thomas Jefferson.  Thomas Jefferson was a political philosopher and a businessman and a president but he was also an architect and his architecture was so good, it’s on the back of the nickel. When you go to Washington, D.C.  you are seeing the outworking of Thomas Jefferson's brilliant architectual mind.\n\nSolomon was like this.  He built amazing wonders of the world for himself to live in.  He had houses and summer houses and hunting retreats and beach houses.  \n\nBut it didn’t make him happy.  It didn’t bring fulfillment.\n\nSo the next thing Solomon want after was…\n\n### Stuff (7-8)\n\nLook at verses 7-8\n\n> *”I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:  I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.”*\n\n\nSolomon had thousands of people working for him.  He had more wealth than anyone in the world.  They didn’t have Amazon Music in Solomon’s day. There were no recordings, but Solomon had private choirs and singing groups who could sing for him any time he wanted music.  \n\nLook at how the Bible describes Solomon’s daily food in 1 Kings 4:22-23\n\n> *”And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal: 23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow deer, and fatted fowl.”*\n\nOne time shortly after we got married, my mom gave Amanda and I a gift card to this Argentine steakhouse in the city where we lived.  It costs like $50 a person to go to this place and there were no menus.  You just went in and this Argentine cowboy came by with a giant speak and on the spear was ten different kinds of steak and he would just come up to your table, you would point at what you want and the man would take out what looked like a machete and cut it off on your plate.  When you wanted more, he would come again.  It was AMAZING!\n\nSolomon had more than that all day every day.  \n\nHe had everything he wanted.  In fact, that is exactly what he says in verses 9-10. Look at them…\n\n\n> *”So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.”*\n\nCan you imagine being able to say “Anything I wanted, I got” - that’s what Solomon could say.  Listen to what one commentator said about this passage:\n\n> Today his face would be on the cover of *Fortune*, his home featured in a photo spread in *Architectural Digest*. Pop stars would sing at his birthday party and supermodels would flirt for his affections.\n\nThat was Solomon’s life.  But look up at verse 1 again.  What did Solomon call it all?  He called it all “Vanity.”  It didn’t satisfy.  Every one of those things *promised* satisfaction - but none of them were anything more than empty.\n\nListen folks, it won’t be any different for you if you live for this stuff.  You could have everything you ever wanted and it still wouldn’t be enough.\n\nSomeone once said:\n\n> Pleasure’s advertising agency is much more effective than it’s manufacturing department.\n\nYet we fall for it every single time.  \n\nIt’s vanity.  It’s empty.\n\nSo this passage is all about the emptiness of pleasure.  But I don’t want you to think from this that pleasure is **evil**.\n\nBecause I want to take a few minutes talking about…\n\n## 2. The one who fills the emptiness.\n\nYou see, **God isn’t against pleasure.**  Psalm 16:11\n\n> *”Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.”*\n\nI want you to understand something.  The pleasures of this life were created by God.  They aren’t evil.\n\n* He isn’t against laughter.\n* He isn’t against enjoying creation.\n* He isn’t against us using our creativity to build beautiful buildings. (Think of all of the buildings and artisanship in the Old Testament)\n* He isn’t against us having stuff (God made it so that Abraham and David and so many other Bible figures were incredibly wealthy).\n\nPleasures **by themselves** are empty. But that doesn’t mean pleasures are evil, just *insufficient* and easily abused.  God designed pleasures to be missing something and that something is a relationship with God.\n\nThe secret to pleasures is that we have to realize their purpose.  They aren’t the steak, they are the seasoning.  \n\nWhat will bring you fulfillment is your relationship with God and your service to Him.  As a part of that, God gives us pleasures.\n\nLet’s look at a couple Bible verses about this:\n\n> *And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.* Colossians 3:17\n\n> *Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.* 1 Cor. 10:31\n\n> *Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:* 1 Timothy 4:3\n\nListen, almost every pleasure I can think of, whether it is a nice house or good food or physical companionship.  It has a place.  God didn’t design us to be robots.  He created us and put us in this world to enjoy it.\n\nBut we can’t live for it.  It can’t become a god.  It can’t become our source of meaning and purpose.  We have to live for God first and other second, and enjoy the pleasures that He gives us along the way.\n\nLet me put it another way and we’ll be done.  The best I’ve ever heard anyone explain this was Jim Berg, a preacher who works at Bob Jones.  \n\nJim Berg said this.  He said that you can think of life like a multiplication equation.\n\nOn the left (the multiplicand) is what we put into it.  You might be a doctor or a multimillionaire and put millions into this side.  You might have some kind of handicap and put very little into this side.  Then on the far right (the product), on the other side of the equal sign is how fulfilled you are.\n\nRight, so this is the part that most people miss: God controls this (the multiplier).  God is the multiplier.  So you can put millions in and God can multiply them by -1 and you can be miserable.  Or you can have very little to contribute and God can multiply it times 500 and you can live a very fulfilled life.  But it’s God that matters.\n\nOne other thing and then we’ll be done.  Solomon said that pleasures are empty.  They are vanity - they are empty - they are blank.  But do you know what - God can fill that cup up.  God can write on that blank canvas.  They don’t have to be empty - they are just empty without God.\n\nSo I guess the lesson here is this - don’t live for pleasure.  Don’t live for the chuckles.  Don’t live for the party or the booze.  Don’t live for the stuff or the nice house or the big bank account.  Live for God.  You might not have all of the stuff this world has, but God has a way of making the stuff that you do have be so much more enjoyable.",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me and turn to the book of James.  \n\nThe Bible is a massive book.  It’s huge. It’s made up of 66 books, written by the Holy Spirit with the help of dozens of co-authors.  It’s easy to get lost in.\n\nLet’s say you struck up a conversation with a man from India who had never known Christians before, and he saw you reading your Bible and asked, “What is that big book you are reading about?”  What would be your answer?\n\nThere are a couple of good answers.  \n\nOne good answer is “Jesus.”  Jesus is certainly the theme of the Bible.  Jesus walked the Emmaus road and taught through the Bible showing the disciples that it was all about Him.  \n\nBut that answer may not make sense to someone who doesn’t know who Jesus is.  You want to get him there, but maybe not yet.  \n\nSo what is the Bible all about?  I think there is a second good answer and it is this:\n\n> The Bible is all about who God is and what He expects from us.\n\nWe see that most clearly in Jesus, but all of the Bible teaches us about the character of God, and what God wants from us as mankind.\n\nI want you to hold on to that thought as we look at our text tonight.\n\n---\n\nTonight we are going to look at just two verses in James 1:  Verses 18-19.\n\n> *”Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.  Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”*\n\nI’ve got to be honest. Of all of the verses in James 1, these two are the ones I was the least excited about preaching.  They don’t seem to make sense.  James is sort of a rambly, ADD kind of writer. He jumps from one topic to another with no warning, and verse 17 always seemed to me like it came out of left field.\n\nOf course, it’s the Bible, and none of it came out of left field. All of it has a purpose.  As I’ve studied these verses, they’ve been encouraging, and I’m actually excited to preach on them tonight.\n\nThese verses teach us about four things: God’s gifts, God’s nature, God’s greatest gift, and God’s purpose for us.  Every one of those things is relevant to us every day.  \n\nRemember that I told you a moment ago that the Bible is all about who God is and what God expects from us.  Well, these two verses give us a fantastic summary of who God is, what the nature of our relationship is, and what God expects from us.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll take a good look at this verse and what it means to us.**\n\nThe first thing I want us to see in these verses tonight is:\n\n## 1. God’s gifts\n\nThe text says: \n\n> *”Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father...”*\n\nThe last time I preached to you from James, it was all about temptation and sin.  I told you that the reason we sin is because we are tempted by our own lusts—our own strong desires to do something that isn’t God’s will for us—and if we give into those lusts, then they result in sin and death.\n\nSin is anything we do, say, or think that is contrary to the will of God.  Anything we do that God doesn’t want us to do is sin.  \n\nAt the root of sin is rejecting what God offers us.  When Eve sinned in the garden, she wasn’t just disobeying God. She was also saying to God, “I think you are holding something back from us. I don’t trust you, and I want to know what it is.”  Every time God says, “Thou shalt not,” and we say, “You know what? I think I will,” we are saying the same thing in our heart.  We are saying, “God, I know you say this is bad, but I don’t trust you.  I think I know better.”\n\nIn a sense, sin always has an element of rejecting what God offers us.  We are saying to what God holds before us, “That’s not good enough. You are holding something back. I want more.”\n\nHere is what James is telling us: **Everything that the world offers us through our lusts turns to death**, and by contrast, **everything that is good and perfect comes from God.**  \n\nListen: God wants you to be happy.  He wants you to be fulfilled.  When I look at my kids, I want them to have a full, happy life.  I want them to have anything that is good for them.  Our Heavenly Father is the same way. We are His kids, and He wants us to have a good life, a full life, a happy life.  He wants us to have everything that is good for us.  He’s not a miser.  He’s not up there in heaven thinking, “Oh, Mark looks like he’s having fun this week and enjoying himself. Let’s see what I can take away from him.”\n\nNo!  No. No. No.  \n\nIf you want to have the best life you can possibly have, trust God.  Trust the will of God.  He knows what is good for you better than you do, and He will bless your socks off.\n\nLook at what this teaches us.  God is a giver.  He’s THE giver.  Every good gift and every perfect gift comes from God.  \n\nGod is good.  Just remembering that and believing that will help you immensely in temptation.  God is good.  Sin brings death.  God brings life.  One road leads to death, while the other road leads to “every good and perfect gift.”  No brainer, right?\n\nSo we see God’s gifts.  The second thing I want you to see here is...\n\n## 2. God’s nature\n\nThe text says, *”Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”*\n\nJames wants to make a point about the nature of God.  God is the giver.  God is good, but there is another part of God’s nature that is an important part of that mixture: God doesn’t change.\n\nSeveral places in scripture, it talks about how God is light and God cannot be tempted by darkness.  Verse 13 says *”God cannot be tempted with evil.”*  1 John 1:5 says this:\n\n> *”This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare we unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.”*\n\nIn Malachi 3:6, God said:\n\n> *”I am the Lord, I change not.”*\n\nGod isn’t just good; He doesn’t change.  He is always good.  He can’t be anything but good.\n\nThat’s what *“The Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning”* means. James is pointing to the heavenly lights—the stars, the sun, and the moon.  The thing about the sun is, at least from our perspective, it goes away every night.  The thing about the stars is they go away every day, they flicker, and they get covered by clouds.  From our perspective, there is variableness there.  Sometimes they are on, sometimes they are off.\n\nThe best lights they had would be an oil lamp, a candle, or a torch, and all of those light sources would flicker and burn out.\n\nJames wants us to know that God isn’t like the sun. God’s light is ALWAYS shining.  God is ALWAYS good. God can’t be anything but good, and God’s gifts are ALWAYS good.  They can’t be anything but good.\n\nIf I were to ask you to talk about God’s gifts—If we were to turn this into a testimony service like we do sometimes near Thanksgiving and I were to have each of you stand up and say “I’m thankful for {{fill in the blank}}”—I know what would happen.  It always happens.  Nearly every one of you would say the same thing.  You would stand here, and you would start by saying.  \n\n> I’m thankful for my salvation.\n\nBecause that’s God’s greatest gift to us, isn’t it? Every other gift we have received from God only makes sense in that context. \n\nAnd that’s just where James goes, too.  Look at the next phrase in our text:\n\n> *”Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth”*\n\nThis is speaking of salvation, which is the third point...\n\n## 3. God’s greatest gift\n\nIt’s saying that our salvation was God’s doing.  It was a gift from God that took place because God wanted it done.  It’s using the picture of childbirth.  God is our Heavenly Father. Just like your earthly birth wasn’t your idea but your parents, your new birth doesn’t come about because of your volition, but because God was birthing you and orchestrating your new birth.\n\nNow, I’m going to be the first to admit that I don’t understand this.  This is the greatest theological debate in Christian history.  Are we saved by free will, or are we saved by God’s sovereign decision?  \n\nOn the one hand, you have the Calvinists who say it’s all God’s doing, and they take it to the extreme that God had a preselected group of people He died for and only those people can get saved.  On the other hand, you have the Arminians who go to the opposite extreme and say that God just created the machinery of salvation, and it’s up to you to do your part in it.  These two groups have been warring in this theological battle for well over a thousand years.\n\nHere is what I believe: I believe that when God says, “Whosoever will,” He means, “Whosoever will.”  I believe that anyone can be saved, and that we should preach the gospel to every creature and that every creature can believe it.  I’m not a Calvinist.  I don’t believe in limited atonement.  I don’t believe in unconditional election.  I don’t believe in irresistible grace.\n\nBut I do believe this: I believe God is behind each and every one of our individual salvations.  I believe you were saved because God was drawing you.  I believe God had more to do with your salvation than you did.  And if you are saved this evening, I believe you can see it as God’s work and not your own.\n\nIf you can imagine the gates of heaven with me, imagine a big banner over the gate that says, *“Whosoever will may come.”*  I believe in preaching that whosoever will.  Anyone can come.  I think the Bible teaches this clearly.\n\nBut on the other side, once you walk through that gate, the back of that banner says, *“Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father.”*  I believe that as a Christian, you shouldn’t see your salvation as your work or your idea, but you should see it as God’s work all along.\n\nI know that’s a paradox, but I think it’s a biblical paradox.  I think we get in trouble when we try to systemize the doctrine of the Bible so much that we explain away either of those two contradictory things.  God’s ways are higher than our ways, and I think that God clearly teaches both of these truths in scripture.\n\nNow, back to the text, it says:\n\n> *”Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.”*\n\nThe greatest gift that you and I have ever received is the gift of being born again by God—the gift of salvation.  Knowing that God was behind that—that it was God’s work all along—is one of the most comforting and assuring truths that you can ever learn.\n\nJesus said in John 15:16:\n\n> *”Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and [that] your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.”*\n\nLook at Romans 8:29-31:\n\n> *”29 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified. 31 What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who [can be] against us?”*\n\nLet me tell you what this truth does for you.  It reminds you that this isn’t about you.  It’s not about your effort.  It’s not about how much you hustle.  It’s about God’s work.  You are God’s work.  You aren’t holding on to Him; He is holding on to you.  He’s doing a work in you.  He started it, and He’ll finish it.\n\nFor a long time, I signed Bibles with the verse Philippians 1:6:\n\n> *”Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform [it] until the day of Jesus Christ:”*\n\nKnowing that I didn’t start this thing and that ultimately God is at work in my life and doing His purpose in me is a comforting and assuring truth, and that is a great gift.\n\nBut salvation is only a part of it.  We’ve seen God’s gifts, God’s nature, and God’s greatest Gift.  The last point is...\n\n## 4. God’s purpose for us.\n\nOur text says:\n\n> *”Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”*\n\nJames is teaching us that the greatest gift of salvation, but that salvation had a purpose.  When God saved you, God had a purpose for your life.  He wanted you to be *”a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.”*\n\nWhat does that mean?  \n\nI’ve got to be honest with you. Until I was studying for this message, I had no idea what the firstfruits were talking about.  It always just seemed like a weird phrase to me, but this is actually really neat.  \n\nIn the Old Testament, in Exodus 23 and 34, and in Leviticus 23, the children of Israel were commanded to bring the firstfruits of their harvest, and sacrifice them to the Lord.  You can think of the firstfruits like a tithe.  The tithe is 10%  right off the top.  That is God’s money.  It belongs to Him.\n\nIt’s holy.  That word just means it’s dedicated to God’s purposes.  It’s sanctified or set apart for God.  The firstfruits were just part of the crop that was given back to God to be used for whatever God wanted.  It was part of the crop that was considered holy and considered to be God’s.\n\nHere is God’s purpose for us: God saved us so that we would be set apart for Him.  He saved us so our whole life could be dedicated to Him and His purpose.  We are supposed to be a living tithe.  \n\nOur purpose in life is to live for His purpose, and to live for His will.\n\nYou might think “That’s terrible! I want to do my own thing,” but you are forgetting something. He’s the giver.  He’s ALWAYS good.  \n\nGo ahead and do your own thing. It will never make you happy.  You’ll be like a screwdriver trying to be a hammer.  You won’t get very far, and you’ll just wear yourself out in the process.  You weren’t meant for that.  You were meant for God’s purpose and God’s will.  So live for that.\n\nSo I guess we have to ask ourselves three questions this evening?\n* Do you see God as the good giver?\n* Have you received the good gift of salvation?\n* Are you living for God’s good purpose?\n\n",

    "body": "Take your Bible’s with me and turn again to Galatians 5.  Guess what? We are almost done with Galatians 5.  We’ve been in this chapter now for more than four months - most of that time I’ve been preaching about the fruit of the Spirit.  \nI’m going to preach from verses 24-25 this morning, but I want us to go ahead and read from verse 16-16.\n\n> *”[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. 18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.”*\n\nLike I said, I want us to focus on verses 25-26.  \n\n> *”[Gal 5:25-26 KJV] 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.”*\n\nYesterday, I went to an Eagle Scout court of honor.  One of Harold’s grandsons - Drew - became an Eagle Scout and they asked me to give an “invocation” and “benediction” at the ceremony.  \n\nTo become an Eagle Scout is a pretty impressive feat for a boy.  Some people have called it a PHD in boyhood.  Since the beginning, only 2% of Boy Scouts earn the rank of Eagle Scout.  It’s up to about 6% now, but it’s still very impressive.\n\nSo we watched as they did this long ceremony and pinned the eagle on Drew’s chest.  And it was interesting, a big part of the ceremony was reminding Drew that now that he’s an Eagle Scout, he needs to live up to it.  He will always be an Eagle Scout so he needs to act like an Eagle Scout.\n\nVerse 24 in our text starts with an interesting phrase:\n\n> *”and they that are Christ’s”*\n\nWhat that phrase means is “Every true believer.”  It means every true Christian.  \n\nIt’s a difficult phrase.  Because listen - becoming a Christian is not like becoming an Eagle Scout.  There are no merit badges.  There are no service projects. There are no ranks to climb through.  I mean, there are.  But they are all impossible.  The standard is sinless perfection and every single one of us has failed that test.  None of us can get enough merit badges or do enough service to earn the rank of born again believer.\n\nBut the beautiful thing is we don’t have to.  Christ did it for us.  Ephesians 2:8-9 says:\n\n> *”For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”*\n\nSalvation is a free gift and the only requirement is faith.  That is what this whole book of Galatians has been about.  It’s been all about grace and how we receive salvation not because of our works and our merit but because of Christ’s merit.  All He requires of us is faith.  \n\nBut then, here it says \n\n> *”And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.”*\n \nSo what does that mean?\n\nWell, this morning I want to give you four things from these verses that are true about every true believer. I think I’ll do two this morning and two tonight. I think when we are done you’ll understand these verses a lot better.\n\n***Let’s pray and we’ll jump right into that outline.***\n\nThe first statement I want you to write down is this…\n\n## 1. Every true believer belongs to Christ.\n\nNotice the phrase again *”and they that are Christ’s.”*\n\nThat phrase is a phrase of possession. A phrase of ownership.\n\nMy dad has this habit of writing his name on everything he owns.  His shirts, his gloves, his tools.  He even developed his own insignia (a duck inside a soup can), made stickers, and put it on everything.  Motorcycle helmet - Duck Soup can.  Hockey gloves - Duck Soup can.  Circular saw - duck soup can.  Everyone who picks up one of those things knows it belongs to my dad.\n\nIn much the same way - we have Christ’s name on us.  We belong to Him.  \n\nBack in Galatians 3:13 it says\n\n> *”Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law.”*\n\n1 Peter 1:18-19 says\n\n> *”Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:”*\n\nWe have been redeemed.  But do you know what that word “redeemed” means?  It means “purchased.”   \n\nListen folks - if you are a believer this morning - you’ve been purchased.  You’ve been bought.  You belong to Jesus.\n\n1 Corinthians 6:20 says this:\n\n> *”For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.”*\n\n1 Corinthians 7:23 says:\n\n> *”Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.”*\n\nWe’ve been purchased.  We belong to Jesus.\n\nNow, what does that mean? I think it means two things:\n\n### First, it means we are his responsibility.\n\nIf we are possessed with Christ, then that means Christ takes ownership of us and we are His responsibility.\n\nThink about this for a second, when you possess something, it is your responsibility to take care of it.  You are liable for it.\n\nMost of you here have a car.  You own that car.  Owning that car means you have to take care of it.  You have to put gas in it.  You have to change the oil.  You have to fix it when it breaks down.  If you are in an accident and hurt people with that car, you are liable for the damages.\n\nNow think about this, because we are owned by Christ, we are his responsibility. It’s on Him to take care of us.  It’s on Him to feed us.  It’s on Him to protect us.  It’s on Him to maintain us.  We are His responsibility.\n\nI can think of no better argument for what we call “the security of the believer” than this - we’ve been redeemed.  We are Christ’s.  We are His responsibility.  If I know anything about the character of Jesus it is that He is trustworthy and He always takes care of His own.\n\nSo belonging to Jesus means we are His responsibility.  \n\n### Second, it means we are at his disposal. \n\nThat’s the flip side of the ownership coin.  When you own something, you can do what you want with it.  If I want to use my table saw as a desk - it wouldn’t make any sense - but it’s mine and I can do what I want with it.  I’m free to use it however I want.  \n\nListen, if you are a true believer and you’ve been bought with a price, that means you have a new boss.  You belong to Jesus now and because you belong to Jesus He should have some say in your life.  He should at least have veto powers over your decisions.\n\nEvery true believer belongs to Jesus.  That the first point from these verses.  The second is..\n\n## 2. Every true believer has had the power of their sin killed through the Cross.\n\nThe verse says:\n\n> *”And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.”*\n\nWhen I first read that I thought?  What does that mean?  “Have crucified there flesh?”  \n\nI was thinking of this in terms of what I need to do.  I read this as “I need to crucify my flesh.”  But that isn’t what the verse says.  It doesn’t say *“they that are Christ’s must crucify the flesh”*.  It says they that are Christ *have crucified* the flesh.\n\nRemember, when the Bible talks about the flesh. It’s not talking about our bodies.  There is nothing inherently sinful about your body.  It’s talking about our sin nature.  \n\nSo what I think this verse is saying is that our sin nature was crucified when we became Christ’s.\n\nNow, let me be real clear here.  That doesn’t mean we are perfect.  It doesn’t mean we never sin.  \n\nWhat it means is that when we trust Christ, our sin nature is **effectively** dead.\n\nWhen Jesus died on the cross, He killed your sin.  He died to save you from your sin. And he defeated your sin three ways:\n\n* First, he removed the **penalty of sin**.  This is past tense. This happens immediately.  When you are saved, you are redeemed.  You have Christ’s record. You no longer have to fear God’s judgement of death and Hell.  Jesus took the penalty of your sin on the cross.\n* Second, he removes the **power of your sin.**.   This is present tense.  When you are saved you get a new nature, you get the Holy Spirit living inside of you and you no longer *have* to serve sin anymore.  Your sin nature is like an old boss - they might still be around but you don’t work for them anymore.  You have to reckon yourselves dead to sin and alive to Christ.\n* Third, he is going to remove **the presence of your sin**.  This is future tense.  Someday we will be in heaven in glorified bodies that no longer have to deal with sin.\n\nRemember, God sees the end from the beginning.  It’s all present-tense to Him.  So in God’s eyes, all of this, past, present and future has already happened.  And all of it took place on the cross.\n\nNow, here is how this effect us.  Because of our relationship with Jesus.  Because we are “one of His” because we are “Christs” we don’t have to serve sin and our sin nature anymore.  We have the anecdote for our lusts, for our affections and for our flesh in the person of Jesus Christ.\n\nRomans 6 talks a lot about this.  It says:\n\n> *”[Rom 6:6-8 KJV] 6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. 7 For he that is dead is freed from sin. 8 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:”*\n\nAnd it gives us this admonition:\n\n> *Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.*\n\nListen, because we are Christ’s we were on that cross with Him and we rose in new life with Him.  I don’t understand that - but that is what Romans 6 teaches.  So our sin nature was crucified on that cross.\n\nAnd what that means in practice is this - we don’t have to serve sin anymore.  We can reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to Christ.  \n\nLook at just a few more verses here in Romans 6 and we’ll be done:\n\n> *”[Rom 6:12-14 KJV] 12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 13 Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God. 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”*\n\nListen, it’s simple.  You don’t have to listen to the old man anymore.  He’s not your boss anymore. He’s still trying to be, but He isn’t. So when he rears His ugly head and says “do this, live for this, you need this.”  You can just say “Nope, I ain’t doing it.  You aren’t my boss anymore.”\n\nFriday afternoon me and Audrey went to the Lincoln Library in Springfield.  I’d never been.  It’s a pretty impressive museum.  A big part of that museum was dedicated to the Emancipation Proclamation.  The act that Abraham Lincoln wrote that freed all of the slaves.\n\nImagine being a slave - literally being owned by a cruel master and then being given your freedom.  You are free.  But the slave master is still around.  What do you have to do?  You have to tell that master he doesn’t own you anymore.   \n\nSo every true believer belongs to Christ and every true believer has had the power of his sin destroyed on the cross. ",

    "body": "# Every True Christian (part 2)\n\nLet’s go back to Galatians again.  I want to finish the message I started this morning, finishing up Galatians 5, and then we are going to look at 1 Corinthians and have a bit of a second sermon as we prepare to take the Lord’s Supper.\n\nLet’s get started, as we did this morning, by reading Galatians 5:16-26\n\n> *”[This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. 18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. 19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, 21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told [you] in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. 24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 26 Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.”*\n\nThis morning I focused on verse 24:\n\n> *”And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.”*\n\nIt’s a short verse, but there is a ton of doctrine in that verse and there was a lot to unpack.  So just by way of review for the people who were in nursery or children’s church this morning:\n\nThe two things that this verse teaches us is:\n\n1. Every true believer belongs to Christ.\n\tRemember, “they that are Christ’s” is a statement of possession.   It’s saying that Jesus owns us, we are His and we said that that means two things:\n\t* First, it means we are his responsibility. \n\t* Second, it means we are at his disposal.\n2. Every true believer has had the power of their sin killed through the Cross.\n\tThe phrase “have crucified the flesh” is discussing something that has already happened.  Our sin nature has been taken care of by Jesus on the cross.  So I talked this morning about how the Cross dealt with our sin.\n\t* First, he removed the **penalty of sin**.  \n\t* Second, he removes the **power of your sin.**.  \n\t* Third, he is going to remove **the presence of your sin**.  \n\nAnd ultimately, what this means is we don’t have to listen to our flesh anymore.  It’s like an old boss that has gone away, we don’t have to obey it anymore, we have a new boss.\n\nNow, let’s look at verse 25 and I want to give you two more things that should be true of every Believer. \n\nVerse 25 says \n\n> *”If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.”* \n\nThat’s even shorter than verse 24, but there is probably MORE doctrine here in this verse than there is in verse 25.  There is a lot of layers here.\n\nBut I’ve got two main points it teaches us.  First, (or third depending on if you are continuing from this morning)…\n\n## 3. Every believers lives in the Holy Spirit\n\nNow the phrase “if we live in the Spirit” is actually a bit of a rhetorical question.  The answer is supposed to be obvious.  Paul is assuming that we know that we live in the Spirit.\n\nTo be Christ’s is to be a person who lives in the Spirit.  In other words, every Christian lives in the Spirit.\n\nIf this confuses you, you aren’t alone.  The doctrine of the Holy Spirit is one of the least known doctrines among believers.  I think the devil has sown more discord on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit than he has on almost any other doctrine.  \n\nBut it’s actually pretty simple. **Basically, the Bible teaches that the Holy Spirit does three things for every believer**:\n\nFirst, \n\n### The Holy Spirit lives in us.\n\nLet’s look at some scriptures on this.  I hope you brought your sword-drill fingers tonight because we are going to use them.  Let’s start here in Galatians and go back to chapter 4 and verse 6.\n\n> *”And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.”* (Galatians 4:6)\n\nOk, ready for another one.  Romans 8:9 -> Go.\n\n> *”But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”* (Romans 8:9)\n\nSo look.  We have “the spirit of his Son” in our hearts.  We have “the Spirit of God” dwelling in us.  And it goes even further, if we don’t have the Spirit, then we aren’t Christ’s.  Pretty strong.\n\nKeep reading here and look at verse 14-16.\n\n> *”[Rom 8:14-16 KJV] 14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 15 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 16 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:”*\n\nSo look, if you are a believer, then you have the Holy Spirit living in you.  You either have the Holy Spirit living in you, or you aren’t a believer.  There isn’t a third option.\n\nSo that’s the first thing the Holy Spirit does for every believer, the second is…\n\n### The Holy Spirit seals us.\n\nGot those sword-drill fingers ready?  Ok, Ephesians 1:13 -> Go.\n\n> *”In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,”* (Ephesians 1:13)\n\nOk, let’s look at a one more:\n\nEphesians 4:30\n\n> *”And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.”* (Ephesians 4:30)\n\nSo not only are we indwelled but we are sealed.\n\nIn the ancient world, if you were an important person, you had your own seal and when you wrote a document, you would drip wax on it and press your seal into the wax.  This would do two things: First, it would ensure that no one opened the document before they were supposed to.  Second, it would let the person know that this document really came from the important person.\n\nSo think about this, the Holy Spirit is sealing us.  He’s keeping us.  This means two things:\n\nFirst, it means that no one is going to get to us until it’s God’s time.  Again, this is a wonderful teaching on the security of a believer in Christ.  We’ve been sealed.  \n\nSecond, it means that we really belong to Jesus.  We’ve been sealed, we have that seal of the Holy Spirit on us.\n\nSo the Holy Spirit lives in us and seals us.  One more thing the Holy Spirit does for every believer:\n\n### The Holy Spirit is our Downpayment of Heaven\n\nReady for one more “sword drill?”  Ephesians 1:14 -> Go.\n\n> *”Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.”* (Ephesians 1:14)\n\n2 Corinthians 1:22 -> Go.\n\n> *”Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.”* (2 Corinthians 1:22)\n\n2 Corinthians 5:5 -> Go.\n\n> *”Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.”* (2 Cor. 5:5)\n\nOk.  So obviously the key word in these verses is “earnest.”  The word “earnest” is another word we don’t use much anymore.  It means “downpayment.”  \n\nWhen you put a downpayment on a big purchase, what you are saying is “I mean business here and I’m going to finish what I started.”  And that’s another wonderful purpose of the Holy Spirit in our lives.  It’s as if Jesus is saying “This guy isn’t finished yet.  He still has sin.  He’s not perfect, but I’ve put a downpayment down on Him and someday He’s going to be perfectly and wholly mine.”  \n\nLet me just stop here before I go any further and say this: The modern day Charismatic Movement has taught a lot of things about the Holy Spirit that are just confusing.  The job of the Holy Spirit is to point to Jesus, but the Charismatics make the Holy Spirit a show off.  The job of the Holy Spirit is to confirm our salvation and to bring assurance, and the Charismatics make it a huge source of doubting our salvation.  \n\n## 4. Every believer should walk in the Spirit.\n\n### Walking in the Spirit is the opposite of walking in the flesh. (vv. 16)\n\n### Walking in the Spirit means you don’t have to be under the law (vv. 18)\n\n### Walking in the Spirit will produce fruit in your life (vv. 22-23)\n\n### Walking in the Spirit is a decision Christians have to make. \n\n> *”If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.”* (25)\n\n\n\n# Lord’s Supper\nREFLECTIONS FROM 1 CORINTHIANS 11:17-22\nPurposes and features as set forth by Paul:\n\n1. It is a time to remember (11:23-25)\n\n> *”[1Co 11:23-25 KJV] 23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the [same] night in which he was betrayed took bread: 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. 25 After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.”* \n\nWe remember the life and the death of Jesus, as we take the Lord’s Supper.  It is an object lesson that uses all five of our senses to remind us what our Lord actually went through as He was broken and He bled for us on the cross.\n\n2. It is a time to shew (11:26)\n\n> *”For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come”*\n\nThe word “shew” means “To announce, declare, promulgate, make known, proclaim publicly, publish.” \n\n* We shew the Lord’s first coming and death.\n* We shew the Lord’s resurrection and second coming.\n\nShewing is a declaration and its supposed to be a public one, that we believe.\n\n3. It is a time to relect (11:27-34)\n\n> *”[1Co 11:27-34 KJV] 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of [that] bread, and drink of [that] cup. 29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. 30 For this cause many [are] weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. 33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. 34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.”*\n\n",

    "body": "\"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And all the men were about twelve. And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God. But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.\" Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth. And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the priests, which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.\"\n\n1. What is weird about this story\nYou all know this by now - I'm a big believer in expository preaching. We go through books of the Bible and let the Bible speak for itself. uNo matter where we look in the Bible, we can find instruction. All scripture is given by inspiration and is profitable - not just the fifteen or so passages that I want to emphasize. So we preach all of it and it always speaks to us.\n\nBut sometimes, when we look into the Bible, we find a bunch of stuff that is so foreign to us, it might as well be talking about another planet. This is one of those passages. Paul is come to Ephesus again - he's back from his trip to the temple - and he's hunkering down for some long term ministry there and right away, it gets weird.\n\nA. Weird disciples\nIn verses 1-7 Paul meets some disciples who have fatal flaws in their knowlege. They know about the baptism of John - they know the story and teachings of John the Baptist. They are looking for the Messiah. But they haven't yet been saved. They haven't trusted Jesus. They don't even know who the Holy Ghost is. So Paul preaches to them and they believe and are baptized in Jesus name and they get the Holy Ghost and the signs that went with it in that period.\n\nIt's a weird story because there are no disciples of John the Baptist running around, people no longer get these visible sign gifts when they get saved. It's odd.\n\nB. Weird Preaching Venue\nThen in verses 8-10 Paul is preaching in the synagogues and like they had in so many other places, the people in the synagogues harden their heart to the gospel and turn on Paul. So he goes to another public place - the school of Tyrannus. And preaches there.\n\nIt's weird because we don't have synagogues around and if we did, we would no longer have the opportunity to preach in them like Paul did.\n\nC. Weird Healing Handkerchiefs\nThen in verses 11-12 it gets even weirder. God gives Paul this special ability to heal people and it's so strong that Paul can pray over handkerchiefs and aprons and sick people get these handkerchiefs and their sickness goes away.\n\nNow - I know Binny Hinn sells prayer shawls. I've gotten the ads in the mail. There are a lot of these faith healers that are trying to make a buck. Let me say emphatically - THEY ARE FRAUDS and it is NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE SEE HERE.\n\nIf Binny Hinn and his crowd realy have this miraculous healing power - they need to go down to St. Judes. They need to go to the hospital. You never see that. It would expose them as frauds.\n\nSo that's not something we see today.\n\nD. Weird Exorcists\nThe fourth weird thing we see in this story is in verses 13-16 we have one of the best little stories in the book of Acts. So Paul is so powerful that he's making the charlatans look bad. There is a group who made their living by exorcism and they go to a man who is demon posessed and they are going to try something new. So they say \"I adjure thee by Jesus who Paul preacheth come out.\" And the demon answers back \"Jesus I know, and Paul I know, but who are you?\"\n\nThen, and this is really great, the demon possessed man jumps on them and gives them a beating and takes off their clothes. So they come running out of their naked and beaten. Must have been a site.\n\nThe passage ends with the effects of all of this. A bunch of people see what has been going on and they believe. And some of them who were into black magic burned their black magic books after they believed on Jesus. It says that those books could have been sold for 50,000 pieces of silver. A piece of silver was a attic drachma - it was a days wage. So, 50,000 days wages. The idea here is it was worth a lot of money.\n\nAnd that's where this story ends. A lot of weird stuff. Weird 1st generation Christian problems with John the Baptist. Weird healing. Weird people running around trying to exorcise people. Weird magicians getting saved and burning their books.\n\nWhat in the world can we possibly get from this story? What do we have in common with the people in Acts 18?\n\n2. What's normal about this passage:\nActually - even though we don't have John the Baptist followers, and we don't have people with the gift of healing, and we don't have jewish excorcists and we don't have black magic books - we still have a lot in commom with the people you see in this passage.\n\nYou see, there are four types of people in this passage that are still with us today. And that is what I want to preach to you about this morning. Ask yourself as we go through this - are you one of these types of people?\n\nThe first type of people are:\n\n1.Religious people mistaken about their salvation.\nThat's what we see in verses 1-7. Religious people. Devout people. People on the right track. But they were missing the most important part. They were missing the gospel. They weren't saved yet.\n\nCan I tell you that there are thousands of people in church this morning who are in the same boat. They are religious. They may even be zealously religious. They may be devout. But they aren't saved.\n\nChurch - being religious isn't what saves you. You don't become saved by being in a church any more than you become a car by being in a garage. Relgion doesn't save you. Only trusing in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus will save you.\n\nIn John 3 Jesus met this guy named Nicodemus. Nicodemus was about as religious as you could possibly be. He was a religious leader. He would be a pastor or someone today. He was a good guy. Jesus still said unto him \"Verily, verily I say unto you. Ye must be born again.\"\n\nLater on in the Bible this guy named Saul of Tarsus was so zealous for religion that he made it his life - but he needed to accept Jesus on the damascus road.\n\nThe point is obvious isn't it - there are people - lots of people - perhaps even you who are religious but not saved.\n\nJesus said that one day many people would stand before God and say \"But I did many wonderful works in your name\" and God will say \"Depart from me. I never knew you.\" And they will be put in Hell.\n\nChurch - religion doesn't save you. Jesus does. We see that in this story. We see that today.\n\nThe second group we see in this story is:\n\n2. Religious people who hardened their hearts to gospel.\nPaul preaches in the synagogue to religious people and the text says:\n\n\"But when divers were hardened, and believed not,\"\n\nMany people heard the gospel. They heard it powerfully. They heard it over and over. But they never believed. They never responded and ultimately, their heart was hardened and they turned against the gospel.\n\nThere are probably people this morning who have heard the gospel over and over again. You know you need to get saved. You've felt the conviction of the Spirit drawing you to salvation. You know it. But you keep saying no. Not right now.\n\nDo you know at some point - the Spirit might stop working in your heart. At some point, it may become too late. Your heart will be hardened and it will be too late. I'm convinced that many of the hard core God-haters out there are people who sat in a church like this one and heard the gospel over and over and felt God moving in their heart over and over and they rejected Him.\n\nThe third group we see in this story who are still with us are:\n\n3. Religious people who were in it for the money.\nVerses 13-20 introduce these \"vagabond jews - exorcists.\" Now, I want to be clear - I don't think we have any exorcists in the building today. If we do, correct me. But I'm pretty sure we are safe there. Don't see many of them in the modern church.\n\nBut do you know what we do see - people who have the same problem that these men did in Acts 19 - they are just USING church, USING Christ to get something for themselves.\n\nThey are using it for a business boost. Using it for respectability. Using it for a social group. Using it so their kids have something to do. Using it to pad their ego. Some maybe even using it to line their pockets.\n\nCan I tell you that in todays world - it seems like 90% of people who go to church are in it for them and not in it for Christ and in today's world - 90% of churches are more than happy to cater to that.\n\nSome people use Jesus like their Genie-in-a-bottle. He's just there for them to rub whenever they need something.\n\nSo we have people in this story who are missing Jesus, we have people in this story who are rejecting Jesus, and we have people in this story who are using Jesus. And listen folks, there are probably people in every church who are missing Jesus, rejecting Jesus or using Jesus. Are you one of those people today?\n\nYou see, we aren't so different from these folks in Ephesus. One more group that was in this church and I hope is in our church today:\n\n4. People who were truly saved.\nThe passage ends with people who are really really lost getting really, really saved.\n\nVerses 18-20 says:\n\n\"And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver. So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed\"\n\nPeople were getting saved, and they were changing. They were showing their deeds.",

    "body": "# Faith\n\nI want to start this morning in the Old Testament book of Habakuk.  Habakuk chapter 2.  We are going to look at just one verse in this chapter.  Verse 4.\n\nThe Bible says in Habakuk 2:4:\n\n> *”Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.”* (Hab. 2:4)\n\nNow, I’m going to be honest with you - I don’t know much about Habakuk.  I know he was a prophet that saw the wickedness of his country and knew God was going to destroy it and deeply wanted to see his country revived.\n\nThis isn’t a message on Habakuk this morning.  I just want us to think about the one little phrase we see here in verse 4:\n\n> *”The just shall live by his faith.”*\n\nThis is an interesting phrase.  It’s interesting because it keeps coming up in the Bible.  It comes up exactly in Romans 1:17 where Paul says:\n\n> *”For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.”* (Romans 1:17)\n\nIt comes up in Galatians 3 where again Paul says:\n\n> *”But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.”* (Galatians 3:11)\n\nAnd we see it again in Hebrews.  Four times the Bible says “the just shall live by faith” or “the just shall live by his faith.”\n\nFaith is important.  I mean, we are supposed to live by it.  Right.  We are going to talk in just a minute about just how important it is but it’s really really important.\n\nIt’s also really misunderstood.  I have a personal pet-peeve with this word.  I think it gets used a lot of times as a kind of fluffy filler word.  \n* Politicians will talk about being a “person of faith” when they want a vote.\n* You’ll see the word “faith” on cheesy office motivational posters.\n* You’ll hear people say “have a little faith” from time to time when they are down.\n* We have our “faith” channels with non-stop cheesy hallmark style movies.\n\nAnd the problem with all of this is that no one really knows what faith is.  And the further problem is this: when you do understand what faith is - faith itself is kind of neutral.\n\nYou see, faith is just another word for believing.  You could say it is belief in action.  Just putting your trust in something.  And in a sense - faith can be really bad.\n\nWhat I mean is you can have a lot of faith in really bad things.  In 1978, 900 people put their faith in Jim Jones and drank the “Kool Aid” - killing themselves.  I’d say those people had a lot of faith - they just had faith in something evil.\n\nA lot of people had faith in Bernie Merdoff.  Millions of North Koreans have faith in Kim Jong Un.  Lots of people put their faith in the lottery or put their faith in the government.  A lot of people right now have their faith in Bitcoin.\n\nAnd most people put their faith in more normal things:  They put their faith in their family.  They put their faith in their job.  They put their faith in their country.  They put their faith in their political party.  They put their faith in exercise.\n\nBut when the Bible says *“The just shall live by faith”* it’s not talking about faith in those things - it is talking about faith in God and what God has said and what God has done.\n\nNow, I say all of that as an introduction to our text this morning.  Galatians 5:22-23.  The Bible talks about “The Fruit of the Spirit” and it says:\n\n> *”But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”*\n\nI’ve already spent six weeks looking at these different fruits of the Holy Spirit’s work in our life and I’ve come to *faith.*  If the Holy Spirit is allowed to work in you and through you you will grow in love, you will grow in joy, you’ll be peaceful with yourself and with others, you will be able to put up with people and not be angry, you will be gentle and good **AND you will grow in faith**.\n\nSo I want to preach to you on the subject of Faith this morning.  I’m going to give you three points on Faith.  \n\nThis morning, I’m going to preach on one aspect of this. But I actually think there is a second way to read this idea of faith being the fruit of the Spirit and I’ll preach on that not next Sunday (I’ll be gone) but the Sunday after that.\n\n*Before we do, let’s pray and ask God’s blessing on our message today.*\n\nThe first point I want to make about faith is this:\n\n## 1. Faith is putting our trust in God and His word, even when it doesn’t make sense to others.\n\nYou could say this is the “definition” of biblical faith.  Some people have said faith is merely “taking God at His word.”  Others have said faith is “looking unto Jesus.”  But I like my definition: putting our trust in God and His Word, even when it doesn’t make sense to others.\n\nIn our adult Sunday School we are learning about the book of Joshua.  The book of Joshua records so many times when the children of Israel were told by God to do something that made no human sense.  For instance, when they came to Jericho, this massive fortified city and their greatest military opponent.  Their war plan from God was to walk around the city silently.  That’s it.  Just walk around the city.  On the last day they were to walk around it seven times and then - here is where they really showed their military might - they were to blow trumpets.\n\nDoes that sound like a good battle plan to you?  It’s absurd.  Yet the children of Israel had to take God at His word.  And literally, the entire Bible is full of men who learn to trust God and take Him at this word - even when everything they see and everything they know screams otherwise.\n\nThat’s faith.\n\n* When Abraham has to believe God that He is going to be the father of many nations, even though He’s an old man who has never had children, he was showing faith.\n* When Moses stands before the most powerful man in the world and demands - doesn’t ask - but **demands** that he voluntarily give up most of his slave workforce.  That took faith.\n* When Daniel gets up and goes to his window and prays, knowing full well that a law was just passed against it that would put him in the lion’s den.  That took faith.\n\nSometimes these people showed faith by doing these grand things that didn’t make sense - like these examples.  But most of the time, they showed faith just by following God’s word when no one else was.\n\nAnd I want to tell you this morning - that’s 99% of our faith.  It’s just believing that what God’s word says is true and determining to live by God’s word even if the rest of the world thinks we are crazy for it.\n\nIt’s going to church faithfully.  It’s reading our Bible.  It’s raising our kids based on Christian principles.  It’s giving.  It’s serving.  It’s sharing the gospel.  It’s by living according to God’s morals and not the morals of our society.  \n\nAll of that takes faith.  Because it’s not certain that it’s going to pay off from a human standpoint.  Those of you who are here every Sunday, week in and week out, and you make it a priority.  You are putting a huge investment of time into church.  I mean, just in terms of time, you are giving up 10% of your weekends.  You most precious time all week.  And it’s not certain, not from the world’s eyes, that there is ever going to be a repayment for that investment.  It takes faith.  It takes trusting God even when the world doesn’t see it.\n\nIt takes faith to determinately raise your children by Christian principles.  When your son or daughter says “every one else is doing it” they might be right.  And it’s going to take more than just nominal faith to say “it doesn’t matter - as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.”\n\nI could go on and on.  Sometimes we go through a dark valley of sickness or loss and it just takes faith to keep living.  We just have to trust God that He knows what He is doing and that He is going to bring us through this.  Sometimes just the next step is an act of faith.\n\nSo faith is putting our trust in God and His word, even when it doesn’t make sense to others.  That’s point number one.\n\nPoint number 2 is:\n\n## 2. The only way to become “just” is through faith.\n\nThe phrase we started with says “The just shall live by faith.”  We’ve defined faith - but what does it mean to be “just?”\n\nJust means “justified.”  It is a legal word and a theological word that means our crimes are erased and we are right with the law and authority.\nJustified.\n\nThe truth is we are all sinners.  Every single one of us has sinned and come short of God’s glory.  We’ve all lied. We’ve all stolen.  We’ve all fought hatred and anger and bitterness and lust.  Every single last one of us has a rebellious heart towards at least some of God’s precepts.\n\nWe are sinners.  And the Bible says that God is Holy and God is just.  He is the judge.  And someday He is going to hold us accountable.  the Bible says *“The wages of sin is death.”*. the Bible talks about a judgment in Revelation 20 that is absolutely terrifying.  Let me just read you three verses:\n\n> *”And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.  And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.  And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.”*\n\nWe are all going to be judged based on our sins and on our works.  And all of us come short.  All of us have sinned.  That’s terrifying.  What we need is to be justified.  We need to have our record expunged.  \n\nSo how are we justified?  Do we erase our bad works with good works?  No!  We can’t do it.\n\nThe only way to be justified - the only way to have our record of sins removed - is through faith.\n\nBack in Galatians 2:16 it says this:\n\n> *”Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.”* (Galatians 2:16)\n\nBy the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.  In other words you can’t work your way to heaven.  You can’t possibly do enough good works to erase your sin.  It isn’t possible.  \n\nBut there is a way to be justified and this verse tells us what it is - it is through the *“faith of Christ”*.\n\nJohn 3:16 says:\n\n> *”For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”*\n\nListen, the price of being justified, the price of eternal life is just one thing.  It’s believing.  It’s faith.\n\nNot only do the just live by faith, the only way to be just is by faith.\n\nLet me illustrate it this way. About 8 years ago - we were super poor.  I think we made about 15 or 16 thousand a year AS A FAMILY.  It was rough.  Our car died and we were driving a borrowed 1976 Ford Maverick.  We had nothing.  Just getting groceries was a struggle.  \n\nAnd this wealthy man in our church gave us this card.  Inside the card was a note that said take this to Applebees and get whatever you want on me.  The people there will know what to do with it.  So what is this?  It was just a business card of the manager of Applebees.  Nothing written on it besides a signature on the back.\n\nO.k.  This seems a little fishy.  So do you know what we did?  We timidly drove our borrowed 76 maverick to Applebees.  And we ordered a meal we had no way of paying for.\n\nThen when we got the bill, I had to take out this business card and stick it in the payment thing where money was supposed to go and trust that my friend wasn’t playing an awful trick on us and that he had, in fact, paid for my meal.\n\nI love telling that story because it is such a clear illustration of faith.  We all owe a debt - a sin debt - that we cannot pay.  We have no chance of paying that bill.  But someone has taken care of that bill for us.  When Jesus died on the cross He paid your sin bill.  All that He asks is that we believe.  That we trust His payment.  \n\nWhen Christians talk about “getting saved” that is what we are talking about.  We are talking about the time when we put our faith and trust in what Jesus has done for us and we pray in faith and ask Him to save us.  All of the folks getting baptized this morning have recently done this.\n\nHave you done it.  Have you ever put your faith in Christ?  There is no better time than today to do it.\n\nI have one more point this morning.  So far I’ve said:\n* Faith is putting our trust in God and His word, even when it doesn’t make sense to others.\n* The only way to become “just” is through faith.\n\nMy third point is…\n\n## The way for the just to live is through faith.\n\nOne more time, that phrase we started with that is repeated so many times in scripture says *”The just shall live by faith.”*\n\nI want to tell you that according to the scripture - Salvation is a one time thing.  You are saved in an instant.  God reckons you just because of what Jesus did.  He changes your account in heaven.  He moves you from those other books to the book of life in an instant.\n\nSalvation is instantaneous - but after we receive salvation - we should live by faith.  Here is what that means, it means as we grow as Christians, we learn to trust God more and more.  We learn more about who He is, and as we know Him better, then we should more and more trust Him as He leads our life.\n\nLiving by faith. Walking by faith. \n\nYou see, the Christian life is really simple.  It’s just looking to God, day by day and moment by moment for instructions and doing what He tells us to do.  And the more we know God and the more we know God’s character - the easier that becomes.\n\nWhen you look at some of the men I mentioned earlier: Abraham, Daniel, Moses.  They weren’t just *born* with amazing faith.  In fact, in Abraham and Moses’ case if you look at their early life and walk they don’t seem to have much faith at all.  But as they walked with God they learned to trust Him more and more until it seems like they have enormous faith.\n\nWe are supposed to live by faith?\n\nSo let me ask you just two questions this morning before I baptize?\n1 - Have you been justified by faith?\n2- Are you living by faith?\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "# Fruit: Gentleness,Goodness\nThis morning we are going to talk about two more fruits of the Spirit: Gentleness and Goodness.  Galatians 5:22-23 (I hope you have it memorized by now) says:\n\n> *”And the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance, against such there is no law.”*\n\nWe’ve come to gentleness this morning, and we are going to cover goodness at the same time, because they go together.\n\nOur society doesn’t value gentleness.  I think the last election is about as good an illustration of that as you can find.  Whatever you think of President Trump and the job he’s doing. We literally elected the least gentle person we could find.  \n\nI was watching a video the other day, an interview between a writer I like to watch and a BBC journalist and it was a thirty minute interview.  And literally, for thirty minutes, this ladies teeth were bared and she misinterpreted everything the man said, on purpose, to be provocative over and over and over again.  It was ugly.\n\nThe truth is, we see this everywhere.  You see it on Facebook and Twitter.  You see it on the evening news.  You might even hear it at family get togethers.  There is this willingness to be ugly and to treat people as less than people to prove a point or to win some kind of imaginary contest.\n\nAnd I want to submit to you that that spirit.  That contentious spirit is the exact opposite of the fruits of the spirit.  In fact, if you look up in Galatians a couple of verses at the “works of the flesh” you’ll see that a bunch of them *”variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies”* - those are all basically being a jerk and  fighting with people.   Those are all contentiousness.  \n\nAnd we as believers, if we are walking in the spirit and letting the Holy Spirit do His thing in us, we should be the opposite of that, we should be **gentle** and **good.**\n\nBy the way, **goodness** in Galatians 5:22 is a synonym for **kindness**.  The same word is translated “kindness” many times in our King James Bible.  \n\nGod expects you to grow ever more gentle and kind.  So let’s pray this morning and we are going to do a bit of a Bible study this morning on kindness.\n\n**Pray**\n\nI want to approach this message a little bit different.  Rather than just talk about **gentleness** and **goodness** or **kindness** this morning, I want to show you examples of these traits.  *We are going to look at three negative examples and three positive examples, then we’ll sort of wrap it up by looking inward at our own life.*\n\nLet’s start with:\n\n# Two Negative Examples\n## Nabal\nThe first negative example I want to show you is in the Old Testament.  In the book of 1 Samuel.  So go ahead and turn there.  I want to introduce you to a character this morning who sort of shines in the Old Testament as someone who wasn’t gentle and good.  His name is Nabal.  You read about Nabal in 1 Samuel 25.\n\nDavid is on the run here, he is in the wilderness and they need food. So they go to ask this rich guy near them named Nabal for some food.  Notice what it says about Nabal in verse 3:\n\n> *”Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife was Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and a of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.”*\n\nSo what do we know about Nabal?  \n\n1. the man had a good wife.  In fact, that’s the best thing he has going for him and it saves his life if you read the whole story.  \n2. Nabal had a good heritage.  He was the great, great, great grandson of Caleb.  \n3. Nabal was a jerk.\n\nAnd he acts like a total jerk in this story.  David’s men come to him desperate looking for food and water and look at Nabal’s answer in verse 10:\n\n> *”And Nabal answered David’s Servants and said Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There be many servants no a days that break away every man from his master.  Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?”*\n\nHe was a jerk.  He didn’t just say “No” he said it as emphatically and hurtfully as he could.  In fact, look how the servants describe Nabal in verse 17,  They say *“He is such a son of Belial that a man cannot speak to him.”* \n\nDavid’s first reaction was to wipe him out and he probably would have if it wasn’t for his wife Abigail secretly trying to make amends for her husband and making peace.\n\nSo Nabal.  Nabal is pretty much the opposite of gentleness, wouldn’t you say.  But do you know, I know some Nabals.   I know a lot of people who claim to be Christians who treat people like Nabal treated people.  They think that they have been given some kind of pass to be rough with people.\n\nLook, you don’t get a pass to be a jerk.  Ever.  You don’t get a pass to treat people like dirt.  You don’t get a pass to be rough with people.  I don’t care if you are in the hospital.  I don’t care if you just had an accident.  I don’t care if you have a headache or you aren’t feeling well.  I don’t care if your supposed rights are being trampled on.  We are called to be gentle and good.  \n\nSo that’s the first negative example.  I think a second negative example is:\n\n## Haman\n\nHopefully you know the story of Esther.  It’s a great story.  Esther is this Jewish refugee girl living in Persia who becomes queen of Persia by winning a beauty contest.  True story.  But the real stars of the book of Esther are actually a bad guy named Haman and Esther’s uncle Mordecai.\n\nHaman does something for the King and in return is given a special position and everyone has to bow down to him.  Well the Jews didn’t bow down to anyone - they got a pass.  And the Haman has all the wealth and power and prestige a person could want - but he meets this one Jew who won’t bow to him and he just goes bezerk and determines that he is going to get the man killed and kill all of the Jews. \n \nThink about this - here is a man with everything a man could want.  He was one of the most powerful and wealthy and prestigious people in the world, yet he comes completely unglued by one person who refuses to bow to him.\n\nI remember when I worked for a camp one summer and we hosted a pastor’s conference.  I had just graduated from college and was about to go be a school teacher.  We were greeting these pastors who were coming in from out of state for this conference and I recognized one of them and was holding the door for him and I said “It’s so good to see you brother so and so” and he stopped in his tracks, looked at me and said “It’s pastor so and so.”  \n\nI thought *really??* What a jerk!  You aren’t my pastor.  But I said “I’m sorry Pastor so and so” and then never spoke to him again.   \n\nHaman - don’t be a Nabal, don’t be a Haman.  Don’t be a jerk.  Don’t demand people cow to your ego.  Don’t run roughshod over people.  Don’t take joy in dressing people down and chewing people up.  It’s not right, like ever.  Don’t do it.\n\n---\n\nSo there are two negative examples, let’s look at some positive examples.\n\n# Two Positive Examples:\n## Boaz\n\nTake your Bible’s with me and turn to the book of Ruth.  Ruth chapter 2.\n\nYou know the story of Ruth, she is a woman from Moab, that married a jew.  And her husband dies and her father in law dies and she decides to stick with her mother and law and go back to Israel with her.  And they are destitute.  They are beggars.  They are reduced to going through the fields and harvesting what the reapers leave behind.\n\nSo by providence Ruth ends up in this guy named Boaz’s field.  And Boaz is just a gem.  Look at chapter 2:4.  Look at how this guy treats his employees:\n\n> *”And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.”*\n\nHow would you like to start every day with a boss like that?  But look at how Boaz treats Ruth in verses 8-9.  He sees this refugee girl, this immigrant girl in his field and look at how he talks to her:\n\n> *”[Rth 2:8-9 KJV] 8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: 9 [Let] thine eyes [be] on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of [that] which the young men have drawn.”* \n\nHe could have viewed Ruth as a nuisance, He could have viewed her as a beggar, as scum.  He could have said “It serves Naomi right for leaving Israel in the first place.”  I’m sure many land owners would have driven someone like Ruth off or tried to take advantage of her - but Boaz does the opposite - he shows her kindness and goodness.  He treats her with such amazing gentleness.\n\nAnd do you know what - not only is Boaz one of the great-grandfathers of Christ - He was also a picture of Christ - He was the kinsman redeemer.  \n\nThat leads me to my second positive example of kindness.  Probably THE positive example of kindness and that is Jesus.\n\n## Jesus\n\nI want you to turn with me to the Old Testament book of Isaiah.  Chapter 42.  We are going to read verses 1:4. Isaiah 42:1-4:\n\n> *”1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, [in whom] my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. 2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. 3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. 4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.\"*\n\nObviously, this is talking about Jesus.  In fact, the book of Matthew tells us explicitly that Jesus was the fulfillment of this prophecy.  But I want you to notice how it describes Jesus.  It says in verse 2:\n\n*”He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard.”*\n\nWhat does that mean?  It means he won’t be a bully.  He won’t be a loudmouth. He won’t be someone who makes himself the center of attention.  \n\nLook at the next verse - this one is more familiar:\n\n> *”3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.”*\n\nA reed is a really fragile plant.  If you have a reed and it’s bruised, it will just fall apart.  You have to be really gentle with a bruised reed or it will snap.  \n\nA flax was used to start a fire.  It was basically like a match, but it only smoked, and it was really easy to put out.  If you wanted to fan it into flames, you had to be careful and gentle with it and blow on it.\n\nSo you take these two verses and what do they say about the character of Jesus?  He was gentle.  He wasn’t self-assertive.  He wasn’t a loudmouth.  He wasn’t the kind of person who rode roughshod over people.  He was kind.  He didn’t throw people away.  \n\nAnd you see that in his life and ministry don’t you?  You see that in the way that he dealt with people.  You see that in the way he handled his disciples.  He asked probing questions and He definitely would stand for what is right, but Jesus was never a jerk about it.  \n\nThink about this - Jesus is the King of Kings and Lord of Lords.  He’s the person it’s all about.  He is the center of everything.  Yet, he came to this earth in the humblest way possible and he lived out his life in complete humility.  He didn’t present himself on a white horse - a battle steed, He presented himself on a donkey, the symbol of peace.  He was gentle.  He was the very example of gentleness.\n\nAnd we are to be little Christs.  I wonder - do people see you as more of a Nabal character or a Boaz character?  Are you more like Haman or more like Jesus?  \n\nHow about in your home?  How about the way you talk to your wife or to your husband?  How about in your workplace?  How about the way you talk to the people who work under you or to your coworkers?\n\nDo people see Jesus in you?\n\n---\n\nWell, you might say “Well, I’m just harsh by nature.  It was the way I was raised see.  I can’t help myself.  I’m from a different generation - I’m not some softy snowflake.”  You might say all kinds of things and to answer that I want us to look at…\n\n\n# One more negative and positive example:\n\n## Saul\n\nLet me give you one more negative example.  This one is in the New Testament. You see him in the book of Acts.  Look at Acts 7:58:\n\n> *”And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.”*\n\nThere is this guy in the beginning of the book of Acts names Saul or Tarsus who was absolutely obsessed with destroying people.  You see him here.  You see him in chapter 8 verse 3 where is says:\n\n> *”As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.”*\n\nIn chapter 9:1 it says:\n\n> *”And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,”*\n\nSaul of Tarsus was anything but kind and anything but gentle.  He was a monster.  He was obsessed with destroying people.  He was even willing to go on the witness stand and lie through his teeth if it meant that his enemies - those dastardly Christians - would be destroyed.\n\nBut something happened to Saul.  Saul met Jesus and Jesus changed Saul. \n\nListen, Saul was such a terror that after he was saved, no one wanted to come and see him.  No one wanted him in their church services.  It took another gentle guy named Barnabas to bring Saul into the fold.\n\nBut Saul of Tarsus was anything but gentle and kind.\n\nBut when the Holy Spirit moved into Saul’s life, Saul changed. And when Saul changed he went from this hard scrabble, foaming at the mouth, hateful guy to someone who was gentle.\n\nIt’s amazing how much Paul talks about being gentle.  He describes his ministry as gentle.  He says in 1 Thess. 2:7:\n\n> *”But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:”*\n\nHe tells pastors that they can’t be contentious but must be gentle:\n\n> *”And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,”* (2 Tim. 2:24)\n\nIn Titus he tells pastors that one of our responsibilities is to remind you to be gentle:\n\n> *”[Tit 3:1-2 KJV] 1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work, 2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.”*\n\nHe reminds us that when we go after a brother or sister who has fallen into sin, we are to do it with gentleness in Galatians 6:1.  And he even says in Philippians 4:5\n\n> *”Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.”*\n\nThat word “moderation” is a synonym of Gentle.  In fact the word is translated “gentle” three times in the King James.\n\n\n# Conclusion:\nSo let’s do some soul-searching:\n\nAre you gentle?\n\n* This doesn’t have anything to do with your nature or your personality or your upbringing.\n* This may not be a quality that is sought after in the world, but it is a quality that is demanded in scripture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "# Introduction\nBefore I met my wife I was dating this girl whose family lived in Knoxville.  Super nice family.  They used to invite me to do stuff with their family from time to time.\n\nOne day we were sitting in traffic in the back of their car and someone pulled out in front of us and stopped to turn left.  It was the kind of little annoyance that probably happens to everyone all the time.  But it became one of the scariest experiences in my life.  My girlfriends stepdad was driving and he immediately parked the car, right in the middle of a busy road, got out of the car and starting yelling at and pounding on the car that stopped in front of us.  He exploded.  There was no warning.  It was humiliating and terrifying at the same time.  I remember slinking down in the back seat wishing I could disappear and be a million miles away.\n\nEcclesiastes 7:9.  Which by the way is the text I’m preaching from tonight.  Says this:\n\n> *”Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.”*\n\nJames 1:19, in the New Testament, says this:\n\n> *”Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:”* \n\nPeople are angry.  You see it everywhere.  From riots and protests on TV to talk radio and the tv talking heads.  You see it in politics.  You see it at work.  It’s everywhere.  But the scariest place we see it is in our own souls and in our own families.\n\nStatistically, do you know what the leading cause of women between 15-45 is?  It’s not rape, muggings, or car accidents.  It’s domestic violence.  In fact, domestic violence accounts for more hurt women than rape, muggings and car accidents **combined.**\n\nAnger is everywhere.\n\nI’ve got to be honest with you - I struggle with this.  No, I don’t hit and yell at my wife.  But I can have a very short fuse and for me, one of the ways the old man comes back and says “I’m still here” is in my anger and frustration.\n\nThat is exactly what I’m going to be preaching about this morning.\n\nTake your Bible and turn to Galatians 5 again.  You should be really familiar with this passage by now.  We are going to read verses 22-23:\n\n> *”But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”*\n\nI’ve been preaching about the fruit of the Spirit for a couple of weeks now and we are right back at it.  So far we’ve talked about:\n* Love\n* Joy\n* and Peace\nAnd this morning I’m going to preach about the one in this list that I think might baffle some of you: longsuffering.\n\n*Let’s have a word of prayer and then I’m going to give you five things about longsuffering this morning.*\n\n# Outline\nThe first thing I want to talk to you about longsuffering this morning is:\n\n## 1. longsuffering: defined (or what is it?)\n\nLongsuffering is not a word you hear anymore.  If fact, as I was typing this, I had to add it to my computers dictionary because it kept telling me it wasn’t a word.  But it’s here in my Bible.  Longsuffering.\n\nBecause it’s not a word we don’t use anymore but it is a word in the Bible, I think we need to do a little word study.  \n\nThe word *“Longsuffering”* is the greek word *“makrothumia.”*  That clears it up.  Let’s move on.  (Just kidding.)\n\n*Makrothumia* is actually a compound word like the English words “pancake” , “softball” and “keyboard.”  It’s just two words stuck together.\n\n*Makro* means **long**.  It’s actually still a prefix we use today.  Have you heard of *macroeconomics* or *macrocosm*?  It’s the opposite of “micro” which means “short” or “close.”  \n\nSo long.\n\nBut what does *“thumia”* mean?  *”thumos”* is a Greek word that means “wrath”, “anger” and “fierceness.”\n\nSo literally, this word “longsuffering” means “long wrath” or “long anger” or let’s really put it in modern terms - “long fuse.”\n\nLongsuffering, then, is the ability to go through annoyances and trouble without blowing up.  It is what James calls being “slow to wrath.”  It is taking the anger and annoyance dial and turning it way, way, way down.\n\nLong wrath.  Longsuffering.\n\nSo that is what longsuffering is.  Let’s look at the second point:\n\n## 2. longsuffering: prescribed (or why do we need it?)\n\nWe don’t use the “word” longsuffering today, but that doesn’t mean the Bible doesn’t use it - a lot.  There are at least five times in the New Testament where the Bible says we Christians are supposed to be longsuffering.\n\nLook at a couple of verses with me:\n\n> (2 Corinthians 6:6) *By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,*\n\n> (Eph 4:2) *With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;*\n\n> (Col 1:11) *Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness*\n\n> (Col 3:12) *Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;*\n \nNow, I want you to notice two things about all of these verses:\n\nFirst, None of these verses **command** longsuffering.  None of them say “Be ye longsuffering” - you, you over there “will yourself to have a long fuse.”   They don’t say that.\n\nThe second thing to notice here is the reason why it’s not framed as a command: Longsuffering is a byproduct of walking with God.  In other words, when you get your relationship with God right, God will take care of your anger issues.\n\nSo let’s get right to it and look at the third point:\n\n## 3. longsuffering:  obtained (or how do I get it?)\n\nRemember - the fruit of the Spirit (and Longsuffering is a fruit of the spirit) don’t come through effort.  They come through walking in the spirit.  We have two options, we can walk in the flesh or we can walk in the spirit.  We can walk in the old man or we can walk in the new man.  We can be carnal or spiritual.\n\nGod wants to work in your heart.  God wants to change you from the inside out.  You know this.  You saw this last week.  God is doing something through His Holy Spirit in your life and if you yield to the Holy Spirit and you learn from the Holy Spirit it’s going to produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit which includes longsuffering.\n\nIf you are reading your Bible.  If you are keeping up your prayer life.  If you are walking with God.  God is going to help you with your anger problem.\n\n## 4. longsuffering:  diagnosed (or what does it mean when I don’t have it?)\n\nAnd the opposite is true: If you are blowing up all the time. If you are mister short fuse.  If your anger gets the better of you often, then that is a symptom that you aren’t letting God work in your life.\n\nSo how do you act when people wrong you?  Let’s get where we live: how do you act when your wife doesn’t do what you expect her to do?  Ladies, when your husband does that thing you can’t stand *again* how do you handle it?  Mom. Dad.  How about when your kids are out of control?  What about when your boss or your employee ticks you off *again.*. \n\nDo you blow up?\nMaybe others don’t see it, but are you blowing up inside?\n\nIt may be that the problem isn’t the problem at all.  The problem is in your walk with God.\n\nI want to take this somewhere you probably aren’t thinking about.  I want everyone to turn with me to Matthew 5.  Let’s read verses 39-42 together:\n\n\n> [Mat 5:38-42 KJV] *38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also. 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.*\n\n\n\n\n## 5. longsuffering: exemplified (or what does it look like?)\n\nAnd this brings me to our fourth point about longsuffering. \n\nI told you there were a lot of Bible verses about longsuffering.  But the vast majority of those bible verses aren’t about *our* longsuffering.  They are about *God’s* longsuffering.\n\nSo if you want to see longsuffering in action, then you look at God.  Look at some of these verses:\n\n> (2 Peter 3:9) *9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.*\n\nThere is no greater example of “long wrath” than God.  I mean, look around. This world is just chock full of people who despise God and despise the things of God.  Look at our country - we murder millions and millions of babies every year.  We export immoral filth all around the world via Hollywood.  Our nations is full of people who despise God and who even tempt God.  But God doesn’t judge us.  God doesn’t destroy us in anger.  The only explanation for that is His longsuffering.\n\nOr let’s get more personal - way more personal.  How many times have you blown it?  How many times do you sin against a Holy God?  Even knowing God and knowing about Jesus you live like He isn’t real and you go after all of these idols - money, fame, prestige, pleasure.  God is like a spurned husband.  That is what the whole book of Hosea we were talking about last week is about.  Yet God doesn’t step in and destroy us.  He’s longsuffering.\n\nSome of you have had so many opportunities to trust Christ.  Some of you felt the pull of God on your hearts last week and you didn’t do anything about it.  God is longsuffering.  God is giving you another chance to accept Him and be saved.\n\nAnother verse that talks about longsuffering is Romans 2:4:\n\n> (Romans 2:4) *Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?.*\n\nGod has been putting up with a lot from you in his effort to win you or win you back.  Don’t spurn him.  Don’t despise Him.  \n\n\n# Conclusion/Invitation\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "## Meekness: Being a loser for Christ\nTake your Bible’s with me and turn again to Galatians 5.  Galatians 5.  Two weeks ago, when I preached I said I was going to preach another message on Faith.  Another aspect of faith - faithfulness.  But I studied some more and I don’t think that is the right meaning there.  So I’m going to move on this morning to another word, another fruit of the spirit, “Meekness.”\n\nVerse 23 says:\n\n> *”Meekness, temperance against such there is no law.”*\n\nSo we’ve already done love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness and faith and today I’m moving on to meekness.\n\nAnd right away - I have a problem.  What in the world is meekness?  People talk about love and joy and peace, we know what gentleness and goodness are.  But no one talks about meekness.  \n\nIn fact, the only time you ever hear anyone use the word “Meek” outside of a sermon is as an insult.  When someone is just a coward and who can’t get out of their own shell and can’t assert themselves at all.  We say deridingly “Well, they are meek.”\n\nSo what do you do when you are studying the Bible and you don’t know the meaning of a word?  You do a word study.  You look up all the times that word is used in the Bible and you try to make some sense of it that way.\n\nSo I’ll tell you - the word that is translated “meekness” for us here is found only 9 times in the whole Bible.  The only person who ever used the word in the Bible is Paul.  It comes from the word “meek” of course and it’s only found a few more times in the Bible:  \n\n* Jesus called himself meek. He said “I am meek and lowly.” \n* Jesus said “blessed are the meek” in the beatitudes in Matthew 5.\n* Jesus described his triumphal entry into Jerusalem as Him being “meek, sitting upon an ass.”\n* and in the Book of 1 Peter, it says that women are to adorn themselves with “a meek and quiet spirit.”\n\nBut really - I mean really - there isn’t a lot in these verses to tell us what this word “meekness” means.  It means “gentle” but it means more than “gentle” because over and over again we see both words in the same verse.  It means the opposite of harsh.  \n\nWe see that here: I’ve already preached on “gentle” as one of the fruits of the spirit. So Paul and the Holy Spirit aren’t stuttering here.  Meekness has to mean something else.\n\nSo I looked up the definition of this word:  Strongs Dictionary says it means:\n\n> gentleness, by implication, humility:—meekness.\n\nThe old Websters dictionary says meekness means:\n\n> Softness of temper; mildness; gentleness; forbearance under injuries and provocations. \n\nAnd then goes on to give a religious definition:\n\n>  humility; resignation; submission to the divine will, without murmuring or peevishness; opposed to pride, arrogance and refractoriness.\n\nSo what does it mean?  I’ve thought and I’ve thought on this and I want to give you a really simple, and I think biblical definition of meekness and then I want to talk about this in practice.  Are you ready for the definition?\n\n> **Meekness is letting self lose so God and others can win.**\n\nSo let’s break that down.  \n\nYou see, meekness is all about the absence of **self** from the equation.  I think the easiest way for us to understand meekness is when it isn’t there.\n\nConsiders some of these things which are sure signs that meekness is missing:\n\n**Pride**.  You cannot be proud and arrogant, and meek at the same time.  You cannot be the type that is all about your ego and meek at the same time.  They just don’t go together.\n\n**Stubbornness** is another opposite of meekness.  Sometimes we say to ourselves “Well, I’m not doing that.”  “No way.”  Most of the time this happens when some person in authority, whether its a bureaucrat or a teacher, or church leadership or your parents.  Whatever.  When some person God has placed over you in authority asks you to do something that annoys you and you say “No way.”  And you throw up your stubbornness.\n\n**Murmuring** is another opposite of meekness. When you are whining and grousing about something, that’s an opposite of meekness.  Remember, the children of Israel were judged by God just for murmuring.  Philippians 2:14 says:\n\n> *”Do all things without murmurings and disputings”*\n\nWhen we complain, what we are saying is “I’m too good for this.  I deserve better than this.”  That’s not meekness.\n\nBut I really think the ultimate opposite - the most clear opposite of meekness is **self-assertiveness**.  It’s injecting ourselves into everything.  It’s demanding our way.  It’s demanding our due.  It’s demanding our rights.  \n\nAnd I have to tell you - listen - our culture celebrates this to a certain extent.  How many times have you heard “You have to put yourself out there” or “The squeaky wheel gets the oil.”  You can go to a psychologist and get “assertiveness” training.  \n\nYou have political figures, on both the right and the left, who go around DEMANDING their rights and their due.  \n\nAnd I want to show you a clear biblical contrast to this.  Ok, so go with me to Matthew 5:38-42.  Let’s read this:\n\n> *”[Mat 5:38-42 KJV] 38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: 39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have [thy] cloke also. 41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. 42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.”*\n\n\nThis teaching of Jesus is in the sermon on the mount and it’s radical.  I mean, once you understand this teaching it seems absolutely impossible.  We’ve sort of boiled this down into some trite sayings: “Turn the other cheek” and “Go the second mile” but let me remind you that isn’t what Jesus intended here.  He was talking to real people and giving them real commands.\n\nIf a man hits you - don’t defend yourself - give him the other cheek.  \n\nDo you know what that takes?  It takes a radical removal of **self.**  You are giving up self-protection here.  \n\nWhen a man sues you and tries to take away your coat.  I mean they are coming after what is rightfully yours.  For you to not only give but to give more.  That’s to give up your right to your property.  That’s to remove self.\n\nWhen a man asks to borrow from you and you give to them blindly.  That’s not good financial advice.  Whenever you lend anyone anything there is a good chance you aren’t getting it back.  It’s giving up your property again.\n\nBut the biggest one and the clearest one is the verse that says “If a man compel thee to go with him a mile, go with him twain.”  You know the background of this.  Jewish citizens could by law be compelled by any Roman soldier to carry their pack for a mile.  It didn’t matter how important they were or what they were doing.  They had to stop what they were doing and carry this filthy roman soldiers pack.  But they only had to go a mile.  The soldier had no right to ask him to go any more.\n\nSo when Jesus said “go with him twain” What Jesus was saying was give up your self-rights.  Law your self-protection, your self-property, your self-rights on the table.  Give them up.\n\nAnd right now, do you know what you are thinking, you are thinking “no way.”  No way am I doing that.  How could I possibly do that.  If I don’t look out for number 1 who is going to?  \n\nAnd that’s just it.  You see - meekness is something the Holy Spirit has to do.  No one is naturally meek.  Some people are naturally not-assertive.  Some people are naturally weak.  But no one naturally can take themselves out of the picture like this.  It takes the Holy Spirit to empower us and change us to get here.\n\nLet me give you that definition of meekness again:\n\n> **Meekness is letting self lose so God and others can win.**\n\nThere are two great examples of meekness given in the Bible: Moses and Jesus.\n\nNumbers 12:3 says \n\n> *”(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)”*\n\nMoses was meek.  But he wasn’t weak.  Moses had the ability to get angry *for a cause* he just wouldn’t get angry *for himself.* I mean, you saw Moses get angry when he came down from the mount with the tablets.  He got so angry he smashed them to pieces *then* made the children of Israel drink it.  I mean, that’s next level anger right there.  But he wasn’t mad because Moses got snubbed, he was mad because God was being snubbed.  He wasn’t just mad *at* the children of Israel, he was mad *for* the children of Israel.  \n\nYou see a totally different Moses when people are mocking him or attacking him.  He refuses to defend himself and even prays for those who go after him.  That’s meekness.\n\nThe other great example of meekness is Jesus.  Jesus said in Matthew 11:29\n\n> *”Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”*\n\nJesus referred to himself as meek several times in the scriptures.  But Jesus also made a whip and drove out the money changers.  Jesus also stood up to the Pharisees and told them the truth.  He told them they were blind guides and whited sepulchers and vipers.  \n\nJesus wasn’t weak.  He just took himself out of the picture.  He didn’t get angry about himself.  He didn’t assert himself.  He didn’t demand his rights.  When he was on trial all of these people were mocking him and spitting at him and lying about him and even torturing him and Jesus could have stood up for himself, but he took himself out of it.\n\nSo meekness is letting ourselves lose so God and others can win.  It is the character of dying to self.  Pride inserts me into every situation.  Meekness takes me out of every situation.\n\nNow, lets take a few minutes and let’s get real.  Let’s get where we live.  How can we see this meekness in our own life?\n\nHow about in your marriage?\n\nHow many times do you say “She isn’t doing right by me.”  “She isn’t meeting my needs.”  or “He doesn’t treat me like the princess that I am.”    \n\nYou see it, it’s the “me” there.  It’s demanding our rights.  What’s the opposite of that?  It’s praying “God, help me to serve my wife.  Help me to selflessly serve my husband.”\n\nMeekness says:\n\n> Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; (Ephesians 5:25)\n\nAnd \n\n> Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. (Ephesians 5:22)\n\nWhat about in the **work place?**\n\nYou might catch yourself saying “This boss doesn’t treat me right.”  “This boss doesn’t realize how valuable I am to this company.”  Again, it’s the me again.\n\nWhereas meekness says:\n\n> Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: (Col. 3:22) \n\nWhat about in church?\n\nDo you ever catch yourself saying “they want me to do that again?”  Or “The pastor is asking me to do *that*”.   Or “Nursery again, I’ve already done it once this month.”  Or “I’m not getting the recognition I deserve, I should be a deacon.  I should be the one leading singing.”  \n\nYou know where this is going don’t you?  Ephesians 4:2 says this should be our attitude towards church:\n\n> *”With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;”* (Ephesians 4:2)\n\nNow we can take this and we can apply to every area of our life.  \n",

    "body": "# Temperance\nI want you to take your Bibles this morning and turn to 1 Corinthians.  That’s right.  Not Galatians.  1 Corinthians.  Chapter 9.  Verses 25-27.\nLet’s read this:\n\n> *”And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.  I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:  But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.”* \n\nI don’t know if you realize this or not - but the Olympics are on right now.  The Winter Olympics.  I’m not too big on the Winter Olympics anymore.  I used to be into snowboarding so I’d always watch that and the hockey games, but it’s kind of lost its luster.  But I still love the Summer Olympics.  \n\nMy daughters have both said they want to be swimmers in the Olympics someday.  I don’t want to discourage them, but that’s not something I want for them.  You see, to be a swimmer in the Olympics takes thousands and thousands and thousands of hours of grueling work.  It takes waking up early nearly every day and jumping in a cold pool at 6am to swim for miles, then going to the weight room, then going back into the pool in the evening and doing it again.  Micheal Phelps, in his prime, never missed a day of training for three years.  He trained on Christmas.  He trained on Thanksgiving.  It takes an absolutely insane amount of discipline to do that, day in and day out, for years.  And here is the thing, many, many, many swimmers put in the work and aren’t Micheal Phelps.\n\nThis is true of more than just swimming, its true of running, it’s true of cycling, gymnastics.  Just about every Olympic sport.  Not curling.  But just about every olympic sport.\n\nNow look at Paul’s words here again.  Look what he says:\n\n> *”And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.”* \n\nThat’s talking about athletes.  It says they are “temperate” in all things.  That doesn’t just mean they don’t drink alcohol.  That means they have self control.  \n\nNotice the next phrase:\n\n> *”Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.”*\n\nListen, Christians are supposed to be *”temperate in all things”*.  We have a BETTER motivation for being self-controlled than olympians do.  They just get temporary rewards but we get eternal rewards in heaven for our self-denial and self-control.  So we have to do what Paul says in verse 27.  We have to *”keep our bodies and bring them into subjection.”*\n\nThis morning we’ve come to the last of the fruits of the spirit.  I’ll read the verse - you don’t even have to turn there.  Galatians 5:23:\n\n> *”Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.”* (Galatians 5:23)\n\n**Temperance**\n\nAgain, temperance in the Bible doesn’t mean what “temperance” means today.  The only time people ever use the word “temperance” today is to refer to the “temperance movement” - a historical movement that got alcohol banned in the United States for a decade.  This word isn’t referring to alcohol.  It’s referring to us.\n\nStrongs dictionary defines temperance this way: \n\n> **Temperance:** self-control. The virtue of someone who masters his sensual appetites.\n\nTemperance actually comes from two greek words, *en* and *kratos*.  *En* means “in” and *kratos* means “mastery, control, or power.”  So literally “in control.” \n\nIt was the word that was used for having a strong grip on something.  So the phrase “get a grip” totally fits here.  \n\nSo control over what?  A grip on what?  Well, it’s a grip over our fleshly appetites.  It’s a grip on our internal desires.\n\nLook, all of us have God-given desires.  We all desire food, shelter, friendship, prestige, pleasure, sex, sleep and rest, possessions.  \n\nNone of these desires are inherently bad.  They are all good things.  But all of these desires can also be abused.\n\n* Food, which God provided for our enjoyment, can become a source of gluttony.\n* Our desire for rest can turn us into lazy slobs.\n* Our desire for pleasure can be hijacked by drugs to make us senseless addicts.\n* Our desire for sex, fulfilled outside of the bonds of marriage, can destroy our life and the lives of others.\n\nWe have to get a grip on our desires.  Because when our desires rule our life its not a good thing.  It’s not good for us.  It doesn’t satisfy us.  It actually makes us miserable.\n\nDo you know that?  Do you know that if you get everything you want it will actually make you miserable?  You will lose more and more control over yourself and it will be bad.\n\nProverbs 25:28 says this:\n\n> *”He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.”* \n\nIn Bible times a city without walls was a defenseless city.  It could be taken advantage of by anybody.  It was just waiting for the next group to come along and take it over.  \n\nAnd that’s the person who isn’t in control, who doesn’t have a grip over his desires, he’s just going to get rolled over by the next desire to come into his life.  It’s really, really bad.\n\nI think you see this crystal clear in drug addicts.  I mean, they will do anything to get a fix.  They’ll let there entire life fall apart for a fix.  I’ve seen horrific videos of a mother in the middle of a CVS having and overdose while her two year old daughter cries and tries to wake her up.  Drugs drive people into crime and prostitution.  My brother who is a cop says that sometimes people will have an overdose on purpose and call the cops, knowing they have a drug to bring them back.  They aren’t in control. That desire has just taken over their life.\n\nWhat desire rules your life?  Maybe it isn’t drugs, maybe it’s the desire to stay on the lazyboy and watch TV. Maybe it’s the snooze button. Maybe it’s the desire to procrastinate on your chores.  Maybe its a desire for pornography.  Maybe it’s an unhealthy relationship with food.  Maybe it’s alcohol.  Maybe it’s binge watching Netflix.  Maybe something else.\n\nIt could be something totally different: it could be an unhealthy relationship with work.  That’s a different kind of lack of self-control.  Maybe your desire for work is so strong you can’t take a break and play with your kids.  \n\nTemperance.\n\nRemember it’s one of the fruits of the spirit.  That means, when we are walking in the Spirit, when we are letting the Holy Spirit control our life, then we will have self-control.  We will have a grip.\n\nLet me put it in one sentence for you:\n\n> When the Holy Spirit is controlling your life, your sensual appetites will not be controlling your life.\n\nRemember, walking in the Spirit is allowing the Holy Spirit to live through you.  Being “filled with the Spirit” is like being a glove filled with the hand of the Holy Spirit.  When you are walking in the Spirit, filled with the Spirit, then the Holy Spirit is going to be in control, and the Holy Spirit can’t be in control and your appetites and desires be in control at the same time.\n\nSo how do we develop self control?  Let’s go back to the verses we started with in 1 Corinthians 9:25-27. Because I think that passage has a some ideas that can help us.\n\n> *”And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.  I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:  But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.”* \n\nPaul uses an athletic analogy here when he is talking about temperance, or self-control.  So let’s carry that athletic analogy.  Let me give you four keys to developing self-control: they are dream, rules, routine, and team.  Dream, rules, routine and team.  \n\nThe first one is…\n\n## Dream\nPaul said \n\n> *”Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.”*\n\nIf you are going to master yourself, if you are going to have self control, then you have to have a reason to do it.  You have to have a very big dream.  For olympians it’s standing on that podium and receiving the gold medal.  For Paul it was standing in heaven and receiving a crown from His savior and hearing “well done thou good and faithful servant.”\n\nHere is the deal: if you are going to say “no” to your desires, you have to have a bigger “yes.”  You have to have something that is more important to you than those desires.\n\nThe philosopher Neitsche said “He that has a big enough why can bear almost any how.”\n\nSo developing self-control starts with getting clear about what our “why” is.  Why are we doing it?  What are we after?  \n\nAs Christians, we are all going to stand before our Lord and Master someday and give an account.  Jesus, the one who died for us, the one who gave His life on the cross for my sin and for your sin.  We are going to have to answer for how we lived the life He gave us.\n\nListen to me, if you waste your life growing fatter on the couch binging on Netflix and covered in Cheeto dust, no one may call you on it here, but someday you are going to stand before God and have to answer for that.  If you spend all your time at the office chasing a promotion and neglecting your family and your church and having no ministry whatsoever, you are going to answer to God for that.\n\nJesus died for us and it’s totally reasonable for us to live for Him.  \n\nSo start with a why.  Start with a vision.  Dream.\n\nThe second word I think is a key to self control is…\n\n## Rules\n\nIn our text Paul said \n\n> *”lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway”*\n\nThe words “a castaway” there means “disqualified.”  \n\n2 Timothy 2:5 says:\n\n> *”And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.”*\n\nYou guys know the story of Lance Armstrong.  Greatest road cyclist who ever lived.  Amazing record of 6 tour de France victories.  Medals in the olympics.  All of it taken away because he didn’t strive lawfully.  Now he’s a disgrace.  He’s disqualified.  He’s banned from all competition.\n\nChristian, you have to know that there are certain actions that are going to cause you to be a castaway.  They are going to be disqualify you from ministry for awhile.  They are going to sideline you.\n\nYou have to know that if you get overtaken by drunkenness, if you get overtaken by lust, if you can’t control your appetites, it’s going to sideline you from service.\n\nSo a flip side to the coin of a goal is also a healthy fear that you are going to mess it up.  \n\nYour desires can ruin your ministry, they can destroy your career, they can explode your family. You have to say no.  There has to be rules.\n\nSo, goal, rules, the third word is:\n\n## Routine\n\nAgain, in our text Paul said *”But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection:”*\n\nThe way athletes prepare to reach there goal day by day is by making a plan and sticking to it.  They follow a routine.  They follow a plan.  The plan turns into habits and those habits become second nature and before you know it, they are doing things other people didn’t think were possible.\n\nBut it wouldn’t happen if they only hit the gym when they felt like it.  It wouldn’t happen if they kept hitting the snooze button because they didn’t feel like getting up.  It wouldn’t happen if they kept saying to themselves, “I’m just going to take it easy today”.  There has to be a routine.  There has to be a plan.  That plan needs to become a habit.\n\nSome of you need an old fashioned routine.  You need to develop some habits.  You need to set some limits.  You need to wake up around the same time every day and go to bed around the same time every night. I was reading recently about how they treat people with extreme anxiety disorders and one of the first things they do is get them to have a set time to wake up.  Seems silly, but just getting a grip on something spills over into other areas.\n\nYou look at someone who is amazingly good at something and almost always, it’s because of a routine.  You see an amazing piano player.  That person was probably once as bad as you and the only difference between them and you is that every day, for years, they sat down at a piano and practiced for an hour.  You see someone who really knows his Bible - they probably read and study it every single day for years and years.  This applies to almost anything.\n\nSo a dream - get the incorruptible crown.\nRules - don’t be a castaway.\nRoutine - keep under your body.\n\nThere is one more word that is important to temperance and it is:\n\n## Team\n\nYou know, even athletes that do individual sports like running, swimming, or gymnastics - they practice as a team.  Why do you think that is?\n\nIt’s for accountability.  Your teammates help you.  You know you aren’t in it alone.  They call you out when you are being lazy.\n\nCan I submit to you that in this matter of Christian temperance, you are on a team, it’s your local church.  You have coaches.  Your pastor.  Listen, this is really, really old-school - but that’s ok.  \n\nYour fellow church members ought to have leeway to speak into your life and help you develop some self-control. Your pastor ought to be able to tell you, lovingly, that you certain habits and actions aren’t good for you and will cause you to lose your grip.\n\nOn the flip side we ought to be encouraging one another.  Encouraging each other towards good habits and actions.\n\nIn your family, are you encouraging each other and keeping each other accountable to have temperance?\n\n\n\n\n",

We are going to read the story and I’m going to briefly summarize what I spent a lot of time talking about this morning and then we are going to jump into the application of it.\n\nI’m not going to read the whole passage again.  But let’s read verses 16-16\n\n\n> There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly. And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present. And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law: And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs. What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them; Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law. As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.\n\nLet me remind you again what we saw this morning:\n\nPaul was bringing a gift to Jerusalem to help the poor jewish believers there.  When he got there, he gave the gift and reported on his ministry.  The elders rejoiced with him, but then said that Paul was in a little bit of trouble because there were many, many Christians in the church who were still zealous jews and the jews heard a rumor that Paul was teaching jews they didn’t have to be jewish anymore.\n\nThat rumor was false.  Paul didn’t teach that.  Not yet. But that didn’t stop people from repeating it.\n\nSo the elders told Paul he had to go to the temple with four guys who were doing a jewish vow and he had to stay with them through the whole process and then pay for their sacrifices. This way the jews would see Paul being a good jew and the controversy would go away.\n\nSo even though the critics were wrong, and even though the whole thing was wrong, Paul ate some humble pie and went to the Temple.  Inside the temple, a group of jews grabbed Paul said a bunch of untrue things about him and then started beating him to death, the only thing that saved Paul from being killed was being arrested by Roman soldiers and he would be under Roman arrest until he died.\n\nLike I said this morning, the amazing thing about this story was Paul’s humility.  He was right all along, but he didn’t defend himself.  He was attacked by people he was coming to help and he never bit back.  He never got proud.  He never showed his ego.  He went the second mile to be a peacemaker.\n\nBut there are some other aspects to this story that I wanted to open up this morning but I didn’t have time.  So I’m going to give you two points tonight and they are all going to points of application based on \n\n# What it teaches us:\n\nSo that’s the story.  But what I really want to get to is what it means because I think this story still speaks to us today, even though our situation is very, very different.  So I’m going to give you two points of application this morning and then we’ll close.\n\nThe first lesson I want us to learn is:\n\n## A. When it comes to standards, we should give each other a lot of grace and the benefit of the doubt.\n\nRemember, Paul was in Jerusalem and the problem group there were jews.   They were Christians, but they hadn’t given up the jewish way of life.  They were still trying to live according to the jewish law and they wanted everyone to live according to the jewish law.\n\nThis group of people was actually a huge pain in Paul’s side for his whole ministry.  The whole book of Galatians, and a bunch of 2 Corinthians is dealing with this group.  Even some of the apostles seemed to end up in this group sometimes.  Paul had to confront Peter for being a hypocrite about this.  \n\nNow, put your thinking cap on with me for a second.  Try to empathize with the jewish Christians in Paul’s day.  Most of them lived for at least some time before Christ.  For part of their life - the Old Testament was the Bible.  The law was their life.  It was their identity.  It was supposed to be.\n\nThen Jesus comes and boom - the law no longer applies anymore.  They aren’t under the law, they are under grace.  Gentile believers don’t even have to worry about the law anymore.  So all of the things that they had lived by, their applications of God’s principles, were swept away and they had a really, really hard time with it.  Can you empathize with them?\n\nThere is actually a several chapters of the New Testament written about this very problem.  I mean, it was one of the central problems of the early church.  It was a struggle.  I think it’s a struggle we see here in Acts 21.\n\nWhat’s at the heart of this struggle?  I think it’s this: how we live out the principles of God’s word.  If we are going to put a word on it it’s “standards.”\n\nListen folks - we have these eternal principles here in God’s word.  They should be shaping our lives.  They shouldn’t just be things we give an abstract nod to.  They should change the way that we live, the way that we talk, the way that we dress, the things we watch and listen to, the way that we communicate with the world around us, they should affect the way that we think. Everything. ** If you aren’t taking concrete action on the word of God - you are missing the point.**\n\nListen, I wish as a pastor we could just say “now everyone love each other” or “be good Christians” and that would be that, but in the real world, we have to take the teachings of the scripture and make rules.  As a father, I can’t just post the ten commandments on the wall and say “I’m not going to tell my kid not to cross a busy street because that isn’t in the Bible.”  I’m going to have to make some rules.  In my own life, I have to have some guidelines on how I’m going to live.\n\nIf I’m not taking the principles of scripture and actually trying to live them, what’s the point of reading them.  I’m supposed to be a doer of the word, not a hearer only.  Right?  Right?\n\nBut here is where it get’s messy:  What if my application of the scriptures differs from your application of the scriptures?\n\nI’ll give a couple easy examples: there are a few passages of scripture in the New Testament that talk about a ladies hair.  They say a lady should have long hair and some say that a ladies hair needs to be covered.  So, there are a wide range of applications of that:\n\n\n- You have some folks, like the amish and mennonites whose ladies almost never cut their hair and always wear a head covering.\n- You have some folks, like the apostolics, whose ladies don’t wear a head covering but they almost never cut their hair.\n- You have some folks, like orthodox presbyterians, who believe that ladies should wear a head covering in church, but who don’t make a big deal about how long a ladies hair is so long as they don’t have a crew cut.\n- Then you have most baptists, who don’t make a big deal of this at all except to say that ladies shouldn’t have super short boy haircuts and that the verses about head coverings dealt with their specific culture.\n\nOk.  So one principle - four totally different applications of that principle.\n\nI’ll give you another example.  How about the whole pants/dress thing.  You’ve got a few verses in the Old Testament law that say that women shouldn’t wear that which pertains to a man, and you have verses in the New Testament that talk about modest apparel.  When it comes to applying that:\n\n- You have people who believe ladies should only wear dresses.\n- You have people who think that ladies should be careful to cover their bodies and dress in a way that is feminine but don’t draw a line on dresses.\n- You have people who think that but who think that ladies should probably always wear dresses in church.\n- You have people who don’t care at all and think the whole thing doesn’t apply.\n\nI’d bet that there are people in our church that have all four of those views.  In fact, I know there are.  There are families in this church that are stricter about this than I am and there are families in this church that are far, far les strict than me.\n\nWe could make examples about this about anything: \n\n- The shows we watch.  \n- The music we listen to.  \n- How many times a week we go to church.  \n- The types of preachers we will listen to and befriend.  \n- Tithing.\n- What we wear to church.\n- What we will and will not do on Sunday.\n\nI could go on and on and on.   So how do we handle the differences?\n\nIn our story, the jewish couldn’t handle the differences.  It was a big problem.  They wanted everyone to live by their rules.  They thought Paul was teaching people to not live by their rules and they were ready to go off on him for it.\n\nSo how do we handle it?  The point is:\n\n**When it comes to standards, we should give each other a lot of grace and the benefit of the doubt.**\n\nNow, let me give you some scripture on this.  Not just grabbing from this story, but let’s go to a whole chapter on this.  Turn to Romans 14 with me.  I want to take the time to read the whole chapter.  Let’s read it together.\n\n\n> Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.\n> \n> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.\n> \n> So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.\n> \n> I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. Let not then your good be evil spoken of: For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.\n> \n> Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.\n\nThis is talking about applying the Bible.  It’s talking about making rules for yourself.  What do you do if other people make different rules than you do?  What if they are stricter?  What if they are looser?\n\nThere are three principles in this chapter I want you to get ahold of:  \n\nThe first principle found in verse 4.  Look at that verse again:\n\n\n> Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.\n\nDo you know what the first principle is:  \n\n### **Mind your own business.** \n\nThat’s what those verses are saying.  Your fellow believers aren’t living for you they are living for God.  They are his servants and if they come to different conclusions than you - whether stricter or looser, that’s between them and God.  So Mind your own business.\n\nThe second principle is found in verse 5.  Look at the end of verse 5 it says:\n\n\n> Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.\n\nThe second principle is \n\n### **Know why you are doing what you are doing.** \n\nYou should mind your own business for others, but you should be able to answer the why biblically for yourself.  Listen: “Because Pastor said so” isn’t a good enough answer.  You should be able to go to the Bible and give a biblical explanation for what you do.\n\nThe third principles is actually found in verse 3.  Look at verse 3:\n\n\n> Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.\n\nThe third principle is \n\n### **Accept the differences, love each other as brothers and refuse to judge.** \n\nLook, there are people in here that take stricter stances than me and there are people in here that take looser stances than me.  But we’ve all been received of God.  We are all brothers.  We don’t have to fight about it.  We don’t have to police each other all the time.  We don’t have to all be a bunch of mindless cookie-cutter drones.  It’s ok if we have different standards on stuff.\n\nIt’s not my place to mock people who have “higher” standards than me and it’s not my place to condemn people who have “lower” standards than me.  We should be able to all get along in the church house.  We should be glad to call each other brothers and sisters who have all been received of God.  It doesn’t have to be a fight all the time.\n\n\n----------\n\nSo that’s the first point, I actually had planned four but I’m just going to give you two.  Back to our story.\n\nSo these Jewish Christians couldn’t handle people who were applying scripture differently than they were.  Ok, and they started believing and spreading this false rumor about the apostle Paul.  Catch this, when Paul went into town, he was actually being lambasted as a liberal preacher.\n\nI can just hear it:\n\n\n- You won’t believe what I heard Paul said in his last message.  He’s going liberal!  \n- He’s a compromiser!  \n- He’s going down!  \n- Look at his lean - look at the direction he’s going!\n- He doesn’t even believe the Bible any more!\n\nAnd they sharpened their teeth and were ready to dig into him.\n\nMeanwhile - nothing they said about him was true.  Nothing.  \nMeanwhile - he was on his way to bring them an offering that he’d spent years preparing.\nMeanwhile - he’s in another country getting the tar beaten out of him for preaching the gospel.\n\nLet me read you something a Christian newspaper wrote about a young preacher:\n\n\n> His style is that of the vulgar colloquial, varied by rant ... All the most solemn mysteries of our holy religion are by him rudely, roughly and impiously handled. Common sense is outraged and decency disgusted. His rantings are interspersed with coarse anecdotes.\n\nA famous Baptist pastor said this about that same preacher:\n\n\n> \"I have — most solemnly have — my doubts as the Divine reality of his conversion\"\n\nThe newspapers wrote articles and made cartoons about him.  Christians all over the place piled on about him and talked about how liberal he was and how he was going to make a mocker of Christianity.  Do you know who that young preacher was?  It was Charles Spurgeon.\n\nIn the 1860s a group of Christian missionaries in China wrote a paper mocking “the pigtail mission.”  That’s what they called China Inland Mission because Hudson Taylor insisted that the men who ministered with him dress like Chinese and adopt Chinese customs.  They were mocked brutally for it and were warned against by many pastors.\n\nDo you get the point?  Let me give you the principle:\n\n## B. When it comes to preachers, we shouldn’t be too quick to condemn them as liberal.\n\nPaul came and they called him a liberal preacher.  Spurgeon came and they called him a liberal pastor and even questioned if he was saved. Hudson Taylor came and they called him a liberal missionary.  Jesus came and they said he was a glutton and a winebibber.\n\nChurch - people don’t have a very good track record when it comes to labelling preachers.\n\nLook - there are pastors, even people in our town who do things I don’t agree with.  If I know without a shadow of a doubt that they are doing something awful - I’ll warn you about it.  But I’m going to give people the benefit of the doubt.  I’m not going to jump to conclusions.\n\nListen church, write this down, **it’s far better to let a guilty person go innocent than to punish an innocent person as guilty**.  That’s a biblical principle.  That was built into the Old Testament law.\n\n### **it’s far better to let a guilty person go innocent than to punish an innocent person as guilty**. \n\nDo you think these jewish Christians made it into heaven and God said “Oh congratulations, you kept everyone straight.  Good for you.”  Or do you think they were ashamed and probably are still ashamed for spreading half-true things about one of God’s choice servants?\n\nWhich one do you want to be?\n\nI’m not here to police other preachers - neither are you.  I’m not here to play Nostradamus about where their church is going to be in ten years and neither are you.\n\nSo let’s wrap this up.  Let me tell you what I think is the one overarching principle of this whole thing:\n\nJust give people grace.  Give people grace.  Treat them like you would want to be treated.  Mind your own business, love each other, and serve God.\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.\n",

    "body": "This afternoon, right before I took my daily nap, I opened the “news” app on my phone and I noticed an article from the New York Times about New Hampshire.  I’m from New Hampshire.  It’s not a very notable place.  It doesn’t make it in the news very often.  So I was really interested what the biggest paper in the country had to say about New Hampshire.\n\nThe article was basically an interview with the chief medical examiner in New Hampshire.  The chief Medical Examiner is the guy the state pays to do autopsies.  The article was about how there is unbelievable drug epidemic in New Hampshire and people are overdosing and dying at crazy numbers.  In the early 2000s, they might see 50 overdose deaths a year, this year before it was even half over, there were 500.  This is in a state with less residents than the city of Chicago.\n\nWhen the interview took place, the medical examiner was doing an autopsy on a girl who was under 30.  It happens all the time.  The article talked about how the examiner is retiring early and is going to go to seminary and become a minister and try to help people before they end up in a body bag rather than diagnose them after.\n\nBut it was what happened at the end of the article that I found really interesting.  The article ended with a statement from the Medical Examiner.  He said “I’m very, very hopeful about the afterlife” then he pointed at all of the dead young bodies behind him and he said “Because this right here is pretty awful.”\n\nIsn’t that depressing?  But it’s also true.  Imagining that bodies aren’t piling up in New Hampshire and Ohio and other places because of the worse drug epidemic in modern history doesn’t make it go away.  \n\nWe had two shootings in the last two weeks: one in our own school cafeteria and one by some loon bag picking off people from a hotel in Las Vegas.  It’s awful.  Absolutely awful and the saddest thing is that most of us are just numb to it.  We just push it from our mind.  But it doesn’t make it any less true.\n\nThere are really, really difficult and depressing things that we have to deal with in life.  Most people don’t ever REALLY think about them.  \n\nWhat does this have to do with Ecclesiastes?  \n\nEcclesiastes is a **dark** book.  Let’s just read the first 9 verses.\n\n> *”The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all [is] vanity. 3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? 4 [One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. 6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. 7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea [is] not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. 8 All things [are] full of labour; man cannot utter [it]: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 9 The thing that hath been, it [is that] which shall be; and that which is done [is] that which shall be done: and [there is] no new [thing] under the sun. 10 Is there [any] thing whereof it may be said, See, this [is] new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. 11 [There is] no remembrance of former [things]; neither shall there be [any] remembrance of [things] that are to come with [those] that shall come after”*\n\n\nLet me sum up what we just read for you:\n\n* “Vanity of vanities” - that means everything is empty.  It’s all empty and pointless.\n* “What profit hath the man in all his labor” - What’s the point?  What’s the point of working hard?  What’s the point?\n* “One generation cometh and one generation passeth away”. We are all going to die and no one is going to remember us.\n* “All things are full of labour” - Everything is hard and the work never stops.\n* “The eye is not satisfied with seeing” - we can’t get satisfaction no matter how hard we try.\n* “There is no new thing under the sun.” - Everything we do has been done before.\n\nNow.  We are in the first paragraph of this book!  We aren’t even through the. First chapter yet and we are just faced with this very dark, dreary barrage of very dark hard truths.\n\nYou could sum it up this way: Life stinks.\n\nIt’s depressing. But do you know what - it’s also an accurate picture of life.  If you don’t believe in heaven, if you don’t believe in God, if you believe what we have here is all we have - this world is a dark, dreary and depressing place.  \n\nHere is what some lost people have said about life:\n\n> We all live in a house on fire, no fire department to call; no way out, just the upstairs window to look out of while the fire burns the house down with us trapped, locked in it.  - Tennessee Williams\n\nHere is what George Orwell said:\n\n> Most people get a fair amount of fun out of life, but on balance life is suffering and only the very young or very foolish imagine otherwise.\n\nOr you could go with an old number sticker:\n\n> Life stinks and then you die.\n\nDo you know what those guys are saying?  They are saying “Vanity of Vanities, all is vanities.”  It’s all empty, it’s all suffering, it all stinks.  Life stinks.\n\n---\n\nThe first verse tells us who wrote the book.  It says it was written by “the preacher” a guy who was son of David and king of Jerusalem.\n\nIf you read the book, there is only one person who could have written it and that is Solomon.  This is a book written by king Solomon.  Remember, Solomon wrote Song of Solomon as a young man.  He probably compiled most of proverbs as a middle aged man.  He wrote this as an old man, looking back at a long life.  \n\nLet’s remember a couple of things about Solomon.\n\n* The man was rich.  He was so rich that kings from halfway around the world would take trips to see if the stories they told about his riches were true.  When you are so rich that kings and queens are like “That can’t be true, I have to see that for myself.” And then they visit you and say “Not the half has been told.”  You are stinking rich.  Solomon would have easily been the richest man alive.\n* The man was smart.  Solomon was blessed by God with wisdom.  In fact the Bible tells us no one was wiser.  Solomon was off the charts brilliant.  I mean he was crazy smart. He wrote about science and literature and art and knew more than anyone.\n* The man was accomplished.  Solomon didn’t just know stuff.  He did stuff.  He designed architecture that was the marvel of the world.  He travelled all over the place.  He built the temple.  He was an adventurer.  \n* The man was powerful.  Israel was basically the world superpower during Solomon’s reign.  Solomon was probably the most powerful guy in the world.\n* The man was famous.  I mean he was like Coca-cola.  Everyone knew about Solomon.  \n\nNow Solomon is at the end of his life, He’s looking back on all of that fame and learning and accomplishment and power and he’s dealing out some pretty tough truth about life.\n\nLet’s read the rest of the chapter. (12-18) \n\n> *”12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all [things] that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit. 15 [That which is] crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. 16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all [they] that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 18 For in much wisdom [is] much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.”*\n\n\nLook at those last couple verses.  They are important.  Solomon knew stuff.  He saw stuff as it really was.  And do you know what he said when it was done?  He said “It’s madness and folly, in much wisdom is much grief.  he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.”\n\nThis is from the same guy who said in Proverbs: *“Get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding?”*. \n\nSo what is going on here?  Why is this book so dark and depressing?  Why does it seem to contradict so much other things that the Bible says.\n\nBefore I quit tonight I want to show you the key to this book.  It’s found in a single verse near the end of Ecclesiastes.  You have to get this to get this book.  Ok.  If you don’t have this key, nothing in this book is going to make sense and it isn’t going to help you much.  \n\nSo let’s go to Ecclesiastes 12.  I want us to read verse 11:\n\n> *”The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.”*\n\n“Huh?  I thought you said this was the key to the book?”  \n\nHold on with me.  It is.  You’ll see.\n\nSolomon is wrapping up this book in chapter 12 and he tells us that his words are like goads and nails.\n\nGoads and nails.\n\nDo you know what a goad is?  Everyone in Israel would have known what a goad is.  A goad is a long pointy stick that farmers would use.  As they walked beside their oxen or their donkeys, they would stab the animals with the goad and the animals would get moving or stop.  \n\nSo think about this - Goad - a sharp point.  A stab.  Goads hurt. \n\nNails.  These aren’t nails like we use, they would have been much bigger.  They would have been like long tent spikes.  Imagine a two foot nail that you have to drive into the earth with a sledgehammer.  If something is fasted with one of those bad boys, it isn’t going anywhere.  \n\nSo how are words goads and nails?\n\nThey are actually two different things.  You see Goads are man’s thoughts and wisdom.  They are what we see when you really take an honest look at the world around us.  \n\nSomeone has called goads the “Painful and disturbing reflections of men.”  They stab you. They hurt.  They bring a sharp sting.  \n\nGoads.\n\nBut nails, if you read that verse carefully, nails and goads are actually contrasted.  They are two different things coming from two different places.  The goads come from wise men.  The nails come from the shepherd who is the master of assemblies.\n\nSo what are the nails?\n\nNails stand for scriptural principles and wisdom.  Nails stand for the revelation of God.  Goads get us going.  Nails give us stability.\n\nGoads and nails.  \n\nNow, really quickly, let me try to help you understand how Goads and Nails are the key to Ecclesiastes.\n\nEcclesiastes is a book of Goads.  It’s a book of the wise sayings of man without God.  \n\nThere are 11 chapters of the best mankind has to offer without God.  It’s hard wisdom.  It’s true, but it’s dark.  And there aren’t a lot of answers in it.  Just a lot of questions.  \n\nMankind without God can do a pretty good job of diagnosis.  He can look at the world and see the problems and see the foolishness of it all.  He can see the Goads.\n\nSo that’s what Ecclesiastes is - it’s Goads.  It’s the wisdom of man without God.  A key phrase is “under the sun.”  It’s life and wisdom without God.\n\nAnd it’s all goads.  It’s a lot of pain.  \n\nBut do you know what Solomon does here…He gives us the goads.  He gives us the pain.  But he let’s the goads lead us to the nails.  He lets the hard sayings of man and the emptiness of life without God lead us to God.  \n\nWe are going to see a lot of darkness in this book.  And it’s true darkness.  It’s life as it IS for most people.  But there is good news that Solomon is leading us to.  It isn’t life as it HAS TO BE.  \n\nLife stinks and then you die.  That’s one way to live.  \n\nBut you can trade the goads for nails and you can live a totally different way.  You can have joy. You can have peace.  You can have fulfillment.  ",

    "body": "# God resisteth the proud but giveth grace.\nTake your Bibles with me and turn to James 4.  It’s been a while since we’ve been in James.  I went on vacation and then had a missionary speak last Sunday night, and so it feels like we’ve out of this for months.  \n\nIf I were to ask you this question, what would be your answer:\n\n> What is the most important character quality of a Christian?\n\n(Take answers and discuss)\n\nAll of those are important character qualities.  \n* Faith is so important.  *”this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”* (I John 5:4b).  \n* Charity/love is so important.  *”and now abideth faith hope charity, these three but the greatest of these is charity.”*\n\nBut the character trait James is going to talk about tonight is, I dare say, more important than even faith and love.  You could say that faith and love are the door, while this is the hinge.  You could also say that faith and love are the train, and this trait is the track that lets those things get there.\n\nIn other words, if you don’t have this character trait, God can’t use you, and God won’t bless you.  If you do have this character trait, God can bless you.  \n\nI’m talking about humility.  \n\nLet’s read our text, James 4:6-10.\n\n> *”6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. 7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. 9 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. 10 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.”* (Jas 4:6-10 KJV)\n\nThe last verses I preached from, several weeks ago, are about worldliness and double-mindedness.  It left us pretty low.  \n\nFortunately, James starts this little section with an awesome promise.  He says, *”But he giveth more grace.”*\n\nListen: I don’t know about you, but I don’t always have my act together.  I’m not some perfect example all of the time.  I can be worldly just like anyone else.  Every one of us struggles with sin and worldliness.\n\nAren’t you glad that God *”giveth more grace.”*  I believe that there isn’t a sin or a sinner that can exhaust the grace of Jesus.  He’s always ready to give more grace and mercy if we but turn to Him for it.\n\nBut how do we get that grace?  Well, the rest of the verse tells us:\n\n> *”wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble.”*\n\nThis is probably a reference to Proverbs 3:34 which says:\n\n> *”Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.”* (Proverbs 3:34)\n\nBut this is a major theme in the Bible.  If you don’t mind, I’d like us to turn around a bit and look at some of these passages about how important humility is.\n\nLet’s start in Proverbs.  I’ve already mentioned Proverbs 3:34.  Let’s look at some other proverbs:\n\nProverbs 15:33 says this:\n\n> *”The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.”*\n\nProverbs 18:12 says almost the same thing:\n\n> *”Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.”*\n\nLook at Proverbs 22:4:\n\n> *”By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.”*\n\nSo God is saying if you want to be lifted up, be humble.  If you want to learn, be humble.  If you want to be successful and happy, be humble. \n\nThink about the people God called and used in the Old Testament and where they were: Moses was a shepherd in Midian; Saul was out chasing down donkeys; David was a shepherd and the lowliest of his brothers; Joshua was Moses’ loyal servant; Elisha was out plowing the fields.  They were all humble, and God blessed them.  Some of them didn’t stay humble, and that was their undoing.\n\nLet’s look at some more passages.  Look at Isaiah 57.\n\n> *”For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.”* (Is. 57:15)\n\nGod is looking to be close to people who are humble.  One more in Isaiah:\n\n> *”For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.”* (Isaiah 66:2)\n\nSo you see this pattern in the Old Testament. God is looking for humble people.  God can use humble people.  God can be close to humble people.  God can give grace and spiritual blessings to the humble.\n\nLet’s look at a few more passages in the New Testament, and then I’ll go back to James and give you an outline.  \n\nJesus said in Matthew 23:12:\n\n> *And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.* \n\nProbably the most famous verse on humility is 1 Peter 5:5\n\n> *”Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.”* (1 Peter 5:5)\n\nSo God values humility.  God exalts humility.  God gives grace to the humble.  This is very, very clear in the Bible.\n\nNow let’s look at our text again, and we’ll stay there a while.  \n\nI think what this text does is teach us how to have this humble relationship with God.  \n\n# How to get to humility:\nThere are four steps to this: Submit, resist, approach, and cleanse.\n\nLet’s look at each one.\n\nVerse 7 starts with this command: *”Submit yourselves therefore to God, ”* so our first task is…\n\n## 1. Submit (or Stop fighting God)\n\nIf you want to be blessed by God and be the recipient of His grace, then it starts with raising the white flag.  It starts with submission.  It starts by saying, “Whatever you want God, wherever you want, I’m all yours.”  \n\nSubmit.\n\nListen: This submission is not a passive thing. It’s not just giving up.  It’s an active commitment to do whatever God wants you to do.  It’s an active commitment to let God call the shots.\n\nWhenever we chafe against this, it’s a sure sign that we are not humble because nothing is more proud than putting ourselves up against God.  You don’t stand in the way of a tornado and say, “Do your worst.”  God could wipe you out with half a thought.  He’s not merely more powerful than we are; He’s infinitely more powerful than we are.  We need to submit to Him.\n\nWe need to submit our minds to Him; submit our lifestyles to Him; submit our hearts and our affections to Him; submit all of us to Him.\n\nSubmit to God. That’s the first step.\n\nThe second thing this verse says is,\n\n> *”Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”*\n\nSo number 2 is… \n\n## 2. Resist the devil (Start fighting Satan)\n\nWe have to stop fighting God and start fighting Satan.  Satan is trying to shape us and pressure us into his way—into the world’s way—and we have to fight back against that.  We have to be on guard against that.\n\nNotice what this passage doesn’t say. It doesn’t say, “Give your all to Jesus and then everything will be hunky dory and Satan will leave you alone.”  It’s not teaching some kind of total sanctification here.  It’s presenting us an ongoing battle. We have to battle against ourselves and our will, and we have to battle against the devil and the forces of darkness.\n\n\n\n## 3. Approach (Get close to God)\n## 4. Cleanse (your hands and hearts)\n\nGrieve (over your sin and double mindedness)\n\n> *”Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.  Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.  Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.”* (Matthew 5:3-6)",

    "body": "I’m of a certain age where I grew up playing video games and going to arcades. I’m probably right at that age where I’m the first generation who always had video games at their disposal. We had an arcade in our mall as a kid, and sometimes I would go in there and play fighting games like Street Fighter. Every so often, another person would come up, put a coin in, and hit the start button. When that happened, a big message would pop up on the screen that said, “Here comes a new challenger!” \n\nThat’s kind of like what’s happening here. In this passage, each of the major religious groups—The Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the scribes, as well as the Herodians—all approach Jesus one after another with a question meant to challenge Him and ultimately challenge the Bible itself because He is the living Word. \n\nI. The Challenge to Biblical Authority (12:13-17)\n\n--Pharisees (“Separated ones”) hated the Herodians, who supported the rule of Herod and general Roman authority. The Pharisees opposed Greek and Roman influence and authority into Jewish daily life. In particular, they saw the family of Herod as a bunch of usurpers because they were Edomites and not Jews. It just speaks to how much they both hated Jesus that they were willing to work together to try to take Him down. “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.”\n\n--There’s a great irony here in the way the question is presented. These men applaud Jesus for not being taken in by flattery and false praise, when this entire speech is flattery and false praise. In essence, they were admitting ahead of time that their ploy would not work on Him. Jesus saw straight through their ploy. The Bible said He knew their hypocrisy. You may be able to fool other people with a religious act, but you can’t deceive God. The Greek word for “hypocrisy” or “hypocrite” comes from a word meaning, “To wear a mask,” the way an actor on a stage would play a fictional character. The Lord sees through our acts. When we stand before Him one day, there will be no excuses, no masks to hide the truth from Him. \n\n--The tribute mentioned here was the Roman poll tax, which was imposed when Judea became a Roman province in A.D. 6. Taxation represented Rome’s authority over the Jews, so to ask Jesus whether or not He supported it was meant to pin Him on the horns of a dilemma. If he answered “yes,” then He would be seen as pro-Roman and He would alienate many of His supporters (who were still hoping He would be a revolutionary who would overthrow the Roman government and reestablish the kingdom of Israel). If Jesus said “no,” then the Pharisees and Herodians could undermine Him by accusing Him of treason as an insurgent. However, Jesus was not fooled by their trap and instead took a third option.\n\n--The penny here was a denarius, which was the equivalent of a day’s wages in Christ’s day. At that time, the image would have been of Tiberius Caesar, and the inscription engraved on the coin professed his divinity, something most Roman emperors alleged. Jesus is not endorsing the inscription, of course, but we must recognize that we live in an imperfect world with an imperfect government run by imperfect people. That’s not going to change until Jesus Christ returns to set up His kingdom. We aren’t going to agree with everything our government does, but that does not mean they don’t deserve our respect and duty as citizens. \n\n--Jesus approved of paying taxes because the coins belong to the one whose image it bears. The fact that they possessed and used these coins meant they accepted their worth and therefore the authority of the one who minted it. For instance, if you had any Confederate money, it would be completely worthless (other than as a novelty) because nobody recognizes the authority of that government. \n\n--While He doesn’t specify what the things are that belong to God, Genesis 1:26-27 says that we are made in the image of God, meaning that ultimately, all that we are and have belongs to Him. However, Christ makes it clear that this does not absolve us from other earthly responsibilities. We have dual citizenship between earth and heaven. As Christians who are also American citizens, while we may not agree with how our tax money is used, and we can express ourselves through our voice and our vote, we must accept the fact that God has established human government for our good, according to Romans 13. Even if we do not respect the people in office, we should respect the office itself. Keep in mind that when Paul wrote Romans 13, Nero was the Roman emperor at the time, and he is far worse than any president America has ever had. \n\n--Now there are things that belong to God alone, and earthly government has no right to try to infringe upon them or claim them for themselves. In those instances, we must be like the apostles in Acts 5:29, “We ought to obey God rather than men,” but we also have to be ready to face the consequences of standing for the right thing. It won’t always be easy. Thankfully, as Americans, we haven’t had to face much of that yet, but it’s gradually getting there. \n\n--The Pharisees and Herodians marveled at Christ’s answer, but they did not change their minds. Sometimes it doesn’t matter how good of an answer you give if the other party isn’t actually interested in the truth. Now this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be faithful witnesses of the Gospel. It means that we can’t force someone to listen to us, and the salvation of others isn’t up to us. It’s between them and the Lord, so you haven’t failed if you witness to someone and they don’t get saved. You’ve done your part by giving the Gospel. \n\nII. The Challenge to Biblical Accuracy (12:18-27)\n\n--Sadducees (“Righteous ones”) denied:\n1. Resurrection of the body\n2. Immortality of the soul\n3. Existence of spirits and angels\n4. Divine predestination\n\nThey also only accepted the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament) as inspired Scripture. Unlike the Pharisees, they gladly cooperated with the Romans, which enabled them to maintain a privileged, wealthy status among the Jews. \n\n--Imagine being the seventh brother here. Probably a lot of sleepless nights. \n\n--Jesus pointedly says that the Sadducees’ hypothetical scenario (which was intentionally designed to try to make the concept of the resurrection seem absurd) was fatally flawed because they did not understand the Scriptures or the power of God. The resurrection is not merely the restoration of life as we know it. It is an entirely new life. Some people make the same mistake where they think heaven will simply be a better earth. Eternal life in heaven is an entirely different kind of life altogether. Even our human relationships will be different. Now there are still a lot of things about our future resurrection that we don’t know, but that doesn’t make it any less true. Essentially, Jesus is saying that there will be no need for marriage in heaven because there will be no death and thus no need to have children to continue the family line, which is one of the primary reasons marriage exists in our world.\n\n--When we don’t know the Scriptures, we don’t have a foundation for truth and faith. When we don’t know the power of God (which is revealed within the pages of Scripture), we doubt His ability to do what He has promised. “With God all things are possible.” This is why it is so important to read the Bible for yourself and know what it says. There are people out there who will attempt to deceive you, and you can be taken in by Scripture being used out of context. We should strive to be like the Bereans in Acts 17:10-12, who didn’t just take Paul’s word for it. They studied the Scriptures for themselves and ascertained that what he preached was true. Now Paul was not attempting to deceive them, and I’m not saying I am or that Pastor Hayden would, but it is so important to know what you believe for yourself and why you believe it. That’s what got me started reading the Bible for myself back when I was in high school. \n\n--As I said before, the Sadducees only accepted the Pentateuch as genuine Scripture, so they rejected immortality and the resurrection because they claimed it wasn’t taught in those five books. Jesus takes on that challenge as well by quoting from Exodus 3:6, where God says He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Christ says that because God speaks of the patriarchs in the present tense despite the fact that they had been dead for hundreds of years at that point proves that they were (and are) still alive. \n\nIII. The Challenge of Biblical Assertions (12:28-34)\n\n--The scribes were men who were learned in the Mosaic law, and they examined the more difficult and subtle questions of the law. Because of this, many scribes were part of the Sanhedrin, and they’re often mentioned in connection with the priests and elders. This scribe in particular is not antagonistic like the groups from the previous two questions. He actually seems genuinely interested in what Christ’s answer is. There is sincere intellectual curiosity at work here. The word “well” in verse 28 has the idea of being completely right with no room for a counterargument, so he acknowledges that Christ’s answers up to this point have been correct. \n\n--The rabbis counted 613 commandments in the law of Moses. 365 were classified as prohibitions (negative), and 248 were considered commands (positive). They were further divided into categories of more or less importance, so this scribe was asking Jesus to pick which one of these 613 commandments was the most important one, which seems almost impossible at first glance.\n\n--But Jesus did the scribe one better and gave Him two commandments. He starts with what is known as the Shema from Deuteronomy 6, which pious Jews still recite daily even now. In the parallel passage in Matthew, He says that all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments. In essence, every single command in the Bible can be boiled down to loving God and loving your neighbor. If you do those two things, you’ll automatically obey all the others. In reality, Jesus did not esteem one law above the others. He basically defined the law with these two commandments [Use Ten Commandments as examples]. \n\n--The scribe’s answer was right on the money and in line with Scripture. I Samuel 15:22 says, “To obey is better than sacrifice.” Jesus recognized the wisdom of the scribe’s reply by saying he wasn’t far from the kingdom of God. He wasn’t there yet, but he was headed in the right direction because, unlike the other challengers, the scribe came into this discussion with an open mind. Just knowing the right answer isn’t enough. We still must personally put our faith and trust in Jesus Christ to forgive our sins. There is a difference between head knowledge and heart knowledge.\n\n--This passage concludes with saying that no one dared to ask Jesus any more questions after this. He took on all challengers and emerged victorious. There have been many people who have tried to attack and overthrow the Word of God throughout the ages, but it still stands and always will [Example of Voltaire]. Jesus never fails.",

We need to thank God for His deeds (*”thy wondrous works declare”*)\n\n# 2. What God says in this Psalm:\nThe best summary of this Psalm I can think of is actually Matthew 23:12\n\n> *”And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.”*\n\nBasically, the proud world is going to face God’s judgment.\n\nThere are two unfamiliar pictures/phases in this Psalm:\n\n### 1. The Horn of Pride\n(4-5)\n\nThe horn was an animal horn, lifted up as a sign of power.\n\n> [Zec 1:21 KJV] 21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These [are] the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up [their] horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.\n\n### 2. The wine glass of wrath\n(8)\n\nThere is this familiar Bible picture of the cup of God’s wrath.  Look at Jeremiah 25:15-29\n\n> *”For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. 16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them. 17 Then took I the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 18 [To wit], Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as [it is] this day; 19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; 20 And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod, 21 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 22 And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which [are] beyond the sea, 23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all [that are] in the utmost corners, 24 And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert, 25 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes, 26 And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all the kingdoms of the world, which [are] upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them. 27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you. 28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink. 29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.”*\n\nWhat God was saying in this Psalm was that the Horn of Pride was going to be met with the cup of wrath.\n\nWhat are the lessons?\n1. Don’t lift yourself up against God, because He will knock you down a couple pegs.\n2. There is a judgment coming, and the lost will drink of the cup of God’s wrath. (Rev. 14:10 uses the language of the cup of wrath to describe God’s judgement in the end times.)\n3. Someone already drank the cup for us. (Mathew 26:42)\n\n",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me and turn to Acts 18. Acts 18. This is a really neat passage of scripture this morning and there is a lot going on here. To get an idea of all that was going on in this passage we are going to look at some other passages too. Because really - a huge part of New Testament history takes place right here in the verses we are going to read this morrning.\n\nSo let's read Acts 18-1017 this morning.\n\n\"[Act 18:1-17 KJV] 1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come frhem Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. 3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. 5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews [that] Jesus [was] Christ. 6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook [his] raiment, and said unto them, Your blood [be] upon your own heads; I [am] clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. 7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain [man's] house, named Justus, [one] that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. 8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. 9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. 11 And he continued [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, 13 Saying, This [fellow] persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 14 And when Paul was now about to open [his] mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O [ye] Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 15 But if it be a question of words and names, and [of] your law, look ye [to it]; for I will be no judge of such [matters]. 16 And he drave them from the judgment seat. 17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat [him] before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.\"\n\nInroduction: Paul is Discouraged\nThe title of my message this morning is \"How God Encourages the Preacher.\" That's one of the main things that I think we see giong on in this passage. Youe see, it starts with Paul going to Corinth. Remember, last week we talked about Paul at Athens - among the elite. He preached a message at Mars Hill, at the Acropolis, the place where the uppety elites of society gathered and very few people responded to his message. They made fun of him.\n\nBefore Athens He was in Thessalonica where he was run out of town by the jews.\n\nBefore Thessalonica he was in Philippi where he ended up in jail.\n\nAnd so he's on to this city - Corinth. He must have felt like every mission he undertook ended in failure or tradgedy. And he's all alone here. Silas and Timothy are back in Thessalonica. He's by himself.\n\nPaul later wrote about this time and said he was despairing. He was weak. He was heavy. He may have been sick.\n\nYou know, we have this tendancy to think about these \"great men\" like Paul as if they were always on top of the mountain. Like they never had problems or struggles - but that's just not true. They had their battles. They fought with depression and discouragement just like you and I do.\n\nI think one of the main reasons Paul may have been discouraged was Corinth itself. The city of Corinth, where Paul was ministering here, was the most wicked city in the world. It was this natural land bridge separating Greece and became an important city. And it was just a wicked wicked place.\n\nMy family is from a town in Massachusetts called \"Lynn.\" Lynn is called \"the city of sin.\" In fact, one of the earliest rymes I remember learning was \"Lynn, Lynn the city of sin, you never come out the way you come in.\" It's just a rough town. You might think of Las Vegas as sin city, or maybe New Orleans. But none of those places had anything on Corinth. Corinth was just a wicked, wicked place.\n\nThere was a \"temple' in Corinth where they had 10,000 ritual prositiutes. There were only 15,000 people in Athens at this time, Corinth had 10,000 prostitutes! Corinth was so wicked that the word \"Corinth\" came to mean \"no morals.\" If you wanted to call someone loose you said \"Oh, she's a corinthian.\" The word \"Corinthianize\" meant \"to remove all morals.\" I mean, this is a wicked, wicked place.\n\nSo here is Paul, fresh on the heels of a bunch of rough patches. He's probably not feeling well. He's by himself. He's a little bit down and he's in this city that is just unbelievably wicked. You would be discouraged too!\n\nBut here is the thing - God doesn't let Paul stay discouraged. God does several things in this story that encourage the preacher and I think we can learn a little bit about what God does to encourage us.\n\nLet's pray and I'll give you those five things.\n\nLike I said, I think part of what was going on in this story was God encouraging the Apostle Paul. I think we can see 5 ways in which God did it here.\n\nThe first way, and maybe the biggest way that God encouraged the preacher is found in verses 2-3:\n\n\"And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.\"\n\nThe first thing we see in this story is:\n\n1. God encourages the preacher with companionship. (1-4)\nPaul was all alone in Corinth. Timothy was gone. Silas was gone. It was just Paul in this wicked, wicked city. And shortly after he gets there he meets this couple - Aquilla and Prescilla, and they become best friends.\n\nAquila and Prescilla were jews from Italy and there had been some anti-jewish stuff going on there so they were on the run and they ended up in Corinth. They probably were already Christians, and they meet Paul. It turns out that besides Christ, they had another thing in common, they were both tentmakers by trade. So Paul moves in with these two and they make tents together all week and minister together all weekend.\n\nFor the rest of Paul's ministry - this couple would be a constant encourager to Him. He mentions them many, many times in his letters. They were a big huge help to him.\n\nCan I tell you something - this is a lesson that you can learn from this story. You may not be a preacher. You may not have any big obvious gifts for ministry. But you can be an encourager. You can find someone on the front lines of God's fight and you can encourage them.\n\nSome of the folks in this church are so valuable in encouraging me. I'll be down. I'll be discouraged. And they'll say something, or take me to supper, or watch my kids and they'll be a huge encouragment.\n\nSOme of you could be an encouragement to some of these young missionaries that come through. There would be nothing wrong at all with getting their email address and sending them an encouraging email every now and then. Or sending them twenty dollars and saying \"go buy your wife some flowers.\"\n\nYou may not ever be an apostle Paul but you can be an Aquilla and Prescilla.\n\nSo God encouraged Paul with companionship. Listen folks, one of the greatest gifts that God gives us is the gift of Christian companionship. The gift of \"one another.\" We get to share our life with each other - our ups and downs with each other. And that is awesome.\n\nSo God encouraged the preacher with companionship.\n\nThe second thing we see here is:\n\n2. God encourages the preacher with compensation. (5)\nThis one is going to take some explanation. When Paul came to Corinth - he did something we don't see him doing anywhere else - he worked. He started making and selling tents.\n\nIn Bible times, even if you were a pharisee or a rabbi, you had to have a trade. In fact, the jews had a saying that if you are a man and you don't teach your boy a trade, then you are teaching him to be a beggar. Everybody had to learn a trade. They had to learn a way to work with their hands.\n\nCan I just insert my opinion here? I'm going to go all Mike Rowe on you for a second. I think everybody should learn how to support their family. I'm all for college - ok. I think college is important, but 80% of the jobs out there don't require a college degree. Even if you want to be something like a banker or a graphic designer - you are going to better off if you know some other way to support your family.\n\nCan I give a second peice of unwanted opinion here: I think preachers should be willing to work and support themselves. That's what the apostle Paul did here. He supported his own ministry. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\nWhere I went to bible college, they started doing something that I think every ministry school should do, they started teaching trades. So you can get a bachelor's degree in pastoral ministry and get certified as an HVAC technicial or a Deisel mechanic. I think that's a great idea.\n\nSo Paul is working in this city as a tentmaker - preaching on the weekends. But in verse 5 - Silas and Timothy join him. Now - you might ask \"where do I get compensation from that?\" I'll tell you, in both Philippians 4 and 2 Corinthians 11 - Paul is talking about this time in his life and how Timothy and Silas came to meet him and it says that they brought money to support Paul's ministry from the churches in Philippi and Thessalonica. This was a huge encouragement to Paul.\n\nSo, from this point, Paul didn't have to work anymore. He could focus full time on his ministry.\n\nBy the way, when Paul wrote to the Corinthian church - he wrote an entire chapter in 1 Corinthians about why the church should pay the preacher. So this passage has kind of a double meaning. It tells us the preacher should be willing to work with his hands if he has to and it tells us that if possible, he shouldn't have to.\n\nSo Paul was encouraged by companionship but he was also encouraged by compensation. He got some money so he didn't have to work as hard.\n\nThe third thing we see in this passage is:\n\n3. God encourages the preacher with converts. (6-8)\nSo Paul does his normal thing - he goes to the synagogue and preaches to the jews first and just like everywhere else - the Jews give him problems. Serious problems. In fact, Paul was so fed up with it that he said he wasn't going to go to the synagogues anymore. He was going to shake off their dust and move on.\n\nEncouraging right??\n\nBut do you know what's amazingly encouraging? Look at verse 8\n\n\"And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.\"\n\nThe cheif ruler of the synagogue got saved! In the verse before, the guy who lived next to the synagogue got saved! Paul was encouraged with converts.\n\nOne of the most encouraging things that God ever does for us is to allow us to see fruit for our labors. To see Him work in ways that only He can.\n\nListen, when the ruler of the synagogue gets saved - that's God working. God was working there. Today, when we see God do something in someone's life that only God can do - that's a huge encouragement.\n\nThe biggest discouraging things that have happened to me since I've been pastor here have been when people I worked with, prayed with, counseled and tried to help left the church for bad reasons or made terrible life decisions. That hurts. But I can tell you that God almost always answers those defeats with an encouraging victory.\n\nGod encourages the preacher with conversions. Two more things and we'll be done. The next thing I see in this story is really kind of cool:\n\n4. God encourages the preacher with circumvention (9-10, 12-17)\nIn other words - God circumvents, or works against, the plans of our adversaries. There were a group of jews who wanted to get rid of Paul. So they did what we've seen many, many times already - they brought him before the town rulers and made something up. Only, in this story instead of them being beaten and thrown in jail like they were in Philippi or forced to leave town like in Thessalonica - the ruler of Corinth actually says \"leave these people alone - they aren't hurting anyone.\"\n\nLook at verse 17:\n\n\"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.\"\n\nThe leader of the jews is a guy named Sothneses - remember the jews are the ones that are trying to get Paul - Sothenes gets beaten right in front of the ruler and he doesn't care. God was at work here. He was protecting Paul and letting him see it.\n\nWant to know something really cool? 1 Corinthians 1 opens by talking to someone named \"Sothenes our brother.\" Same city. Same name. No one can prove this - but it seems like this Sothenes got saved too and joined the church at Corinth.\n\nSo, all along the way here, God is proving Himself to Paul. He's encouraging Paul.\n\nOne more thing and we'll be finished. Look at verse 11\n\n\"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.\"\n\nPaul was able to stay in Corinth for much longer than he got to stay in other places. I think the last way we can see God encourages the preacher is:\n\n5. God encourages the preacher with continuation. (11)\nYou know, if you look at the NFL - the teams that do well consistently usually keep a coach for a long time. Teams that cycle through coaches every year or two are always some of the worst teams. I think the same can be said about pastors and preachers. It takes a long time. The best fruit comes after a long time.\n\nToo many churches are stuck in this cycle of going through preachers every year or two or three. Sometimes it's the preacher's fault. Sometimes it's the church's fault. Sometimes it's just God's will. But most of the time, it's better if the preacher stays for awhile.\n\nSo five ways God encouraged the preacher:\n\nCompanionship\nCompensation\nConverts\nCircumvention of the enemy\nContinuation\nLook, these are some of the same ways God encourages us when we are doing His work.\n\nConclusion: When the preacher is encouraged.\nPaul wrote his first Bible books here (1 and 2 Thessalonians)\nPaul",

    "body": "# Daniel - Purpose\nTonight I want to preach to you for a little bit from the book of Daniel.  So turn to Daniel 1.  I read this book last week in my devotions, and I was reminded about some important things and I want to preach from Daniel for a couple of weeks.  \n\nI’m not going to do a full book study.  We aren’t going to get into the prophecy at the end of the book.  I just want to hit a few of the high points from his life.  \n\nLet’s get started by reading Daniel 1.\n\n> *”Daniel 1:1-21 (KJV) 1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god. 3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring [certain] of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; 4 Children in whom [was] no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. 5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. 6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel [the name] of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego. 8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 9 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which [are] of your sort? then shall ye make [me] endanger my head to the king. 11 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 12 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 13 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 14 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. 15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat. 16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. 17 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 19 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. 20 And in all matters of wisdom [and] understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians [and] astrologers that [were] in all his realm. 21 And Daniel continued [even] unto the first year of king Cyrus.”*\n\nThere was this great period of about five or six hundred years where the world was dominated by conquerors:  The first of these conquerors was the Assyrian empire - out of Nineveh.  They terrorized everyone and defeated much of the known world and were top dog for awhile.\n\nThen, one of the Assyrian leaders rebelled and setup the second empire, the Babylonian empire and his son, a general named Nebuchadnezzar, fought this epic battle against the Assyrians and the Egyptians and defeated them.  Immediately after that happened, Nebuchadnezzar’s dad died and he was made king of this new huge empire.\n\nThe Babylonian empire didn’t last long - it got taken over by the Medo-Persian empire under Cyrus the great and then that was taken over by the Greeks under Alexander the Great and that was eventually taken over by the Roman Empire and then we are in New Testament times.\n\nDaniel became one of the most prominent people - a ruler really - under the kings of two world superpowers:  First the Babylonians and then the Medo-Persians.  But we are getting ahead of ourselves here.\n\nThe book of Daniel starts right after Nebuchadnezzar defeats Assyrian and Palestine when Daniel is 15 years old.  Think about this - he’s 15 years old.  He’s about the same age as Grace and Faith.  Just a young teenager.\n\nNebuchadnezzar - this great king - conquers Daniel’s country - which was Judah and Nebuchadnezzar was looking for two things from every country he conquered: Treasure and Talent.  Nebuchadnezzar had this policy where he would come in, he would kill most of the leaders and prominent people.  He would take the best and most promising young people back to Babylon and he would leave the poor people in charge of everything.  \n\nIt was a genius strategy because it made the people in these conquered countries very loyal to Nebuchadnezzar and it gave him this vast group of leaders from all around the world who were loyal to him. \n\nAnyways, that’s enough history.  Imagine this from Daniel’s perspective.  He’s 15.  Very likely his parents were killed.  Most of the people he grew up around are killed.  And Daniel is taken 500 miles away to this giant city of Babylon.\n\nAnd Daniel wasn’t alone.  This wasn’t just happening in Judah.  It was happening all over the place.  So there would have been teenagers coming from Egypt and Persia and Assyria and Phoenicia and Lebanon.  All to this school in a foreign city.  \n\nI imagine it almost like Hunger Games.  Pick the best and brightest from each city and let them fight it out in the capitol.  \n\nOr maybe a better example would be like the Carlisle Indian school in Carlisle Pennsylvania.  Our government rounded up the best and brightest Indians young people from all over the United States, gave them new clothes, gave them a new language, gave them a new diet, gave them new names and gave them an education.  \n\nThat’s something like what Daniel and his friends went through:  New names, new language, new clothes, new diet, new city - it’s a whole new world.  \n\nRemember - he’s 15!  He’s away from his parents.  He’s in the most important city in the world.  Can you imagine the temptations?  Can you imagine the struggle?\n\nBut what does Daniel and his friends do?  Look at verse 8:\n\n> *”8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.”*\n\nI want to make talk about two things tonight that jumped out to me when I was reading this story, they are the kind of young people we need and how we get them.  The kind of young people we need and how we get them.\n\nLet’s talk first about...\n\n## 1. The kind of young people we need.\n\nDaniel and his friends grew up to be truly significant people.  Some of the most powerful people in the world.   Daniel served as a trusted assistant to two of the most powerful world leaders who have ever lived.  Imagine being the right hand man of both Winston Churchill and then Ronald Reagan.  Or of Julius Caesar and Alexander the Great.  That’s kind of like what Daniel was.  He was a super important guy.\n\nBut he didn’t start there.  He had to grow into that.  Daniel was 15 when he was taken into captivity - he was 83 when he was thrown into the lion’s den.  \n\nWe need a generation of Daniels.  Imagine the impact we could make if we were raising Daniels.  \n\nWhat made Daniel and his friends great?  Four things:\n\n### A. They were devoted.\n\nThese teenagers loved God.  They had given their lives to God.  They were true believers.  Nothing else in this chapter or in this book makes much sense without this most important thing.\n\nYoung people - kids - do you love Jesus?  Have you given your life to God?  Are you devoted to God’s will?  Do you want to serve God with your life?\n\nAt some point, it has to stop being your parents religion and it has to become your religion.  It has to stop being mommy and daddy’s God and it has to become my God.  You have to trust Christ as your savior.  You have to commit to living a life of faith.  It has to be your thing.\n\nI get it.  I grew up in church too.  I went to a Christian school.  There were a lot of years where I was in church because I HAD to be be.  But at some point I trusted Jesus and it wasn’t just Sunday School stories anymore, it was real.  \n\nAre you young people devoted?  Is God YOUR God?\n\nThey were devoted.  Look at the second thing...\n\n### B. They were developing.\n\nThe only reason why they were taken to Babylon in the first place and not killed or left in poverty somewhere was because they were:\n\n> *”Children in whom [was] no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as [had] ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. ”*\n\nYoung people, do you know what your number one job is?  It is to develop.  It is to learn.  It is to become something.\n\nDevelop academically.  Develop physically.  Develop your manners.  Develop your talents.  Sharpen yourself.  Improve yourself.  Learn skills.  Read books.  Become the kind of person God can greatly use someday.\n\nEven Jesus developed.  Luke 2:52 is the only verse we have to sum up the entire childhood and young adulthood of Jesus and it says:\n\n> *”And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.”*\n\nListen guys and girls: your Minecraft skills aren’t going to help you much in serving Jesus.  Your Call of Duty time isn’t making you a better person.  The years of your life you are giving to YouTube isn’t going to help you do something great.\n\nBe intentional about developing:  Learn to cook, learn to build, learn to play the piano, learn another language, learn how to run the camera or to design or to write code, learn how to fix a car, or how to give a speech.  Read some books.  Build your vocabulary.  Read the classics.\n\nDevelop.\n\nYou can’t be a Daniel and make a difference if you aren’t developing.\n\nSo they were devoted, they were developing, third...\n\n### C. They were determined.\n\nThe verse says they *”purposed in their heart that they would not defile themselves.”*  \n\nThese kids were determined.  They knew that asking for a different diet was risky.  But they were determined to serve God and stay pure.  They showed that determination all through their life.\n\nKids, you need to purpose some things in your heart:  \n\n* You need to purpose in your heart that you are going to stay in church.\n* You need to purpose in your heart you are going to keep godly friends.\n* You need to purpose in your heart you are going to stay pure.\n\nNone of this stuff just happens.  There are powerful forces at work.  \n\nAny old fish can float downstream but it takes purpose and determination to swim against the current and make no mistake about it - you are going to have to swim against the current if you are going to serve God.\n\nWhich brings me to the last thing we see about Daniel and his friends that made them so special...\n\n### D. They were different.\n\nThey were willing to be different and to take a stand.  They were willing to be a little weird if that is what it took to be exceptional.\n\nMy old pastor used to say \n\n> If you want to make a difference you have to be different.  Nothing is made better by adding more of the same.\n\nWhen I was a teenager I went through this phase around 14-15 where I just wanted to be “normal.”  I looked at the other kids in my neighborhood who weren’t in church and I wanted the life they had.  \n\nI think that’s a pretty common thing for Christian kids to go through.  But then I realized this - normal is a terrible goal.  Normal is pitiful.  Don’t be normal, be exceptional. \n\nYou can’t be the kind of person that normal people look up to unless you are willing to be different.  You can’t make a difference without being different.\n\nDaniel and his friends could have gone to babylon and did what everyone else did and we would have never heard of them and they would have made no difference.\n\nWe need young people who are devoted, who are developing, who are determined and who are different.  We need Daniels!  A few Daniels can change the world.\n\nSo young people that’s my challenge to you, that’s the kind of young people we need.\n\nBut I want to quickly cover the second point:\n\n## 2. How we get them.\n\nYou see, Daniel was probably around 15 when he went into captivity, and immediately, he shown as a person who had a strong testimony and godly wisdom.  Daniel was a teenager - the time when we expect kids to be rebellious - and yet Daniel was faithful and true to God.\n\nAnd as I was reading this story, something hit me, something I’ve never thought about before: Daniel had to have been the product of godly parents.\n\nYou see, you don’t become a godly young person by accident.  You don’t become a young person who is devoted and determined and developing and different by default.  Those things have to be trained into you.\n\nAnd the thought that hit me as I was reading Daniel 1 the other day is that if we don’t purposely raise Daniels, we’ll never have them.  \n\nIn Christian circles, we have this view of parenting that our job is just to keep kids from the world.  We need to protect them.  I think we should protect them from bad friends and bad influences.  I definitely think we need to protect them, but if that is all we are doing then we are failing miserably.\n\nBecause Daniels aren’t just people who are isolated from the world.  Daniels are people who can go right smack into the heart of the world with all of its temptations and all of its difficulties and change the world, not have the world change them.\n\nThis is a whole other mindset of Christian parenting.  It’s not just isolation.  It’s instruction.  It’s arming them.  It’s building up young people of purpose and strength and wisdom.\n\nI’ll give you an example I hear all the time.  There is this running joke about having teenaged girls that the girl brings a boy home and the dad goes and gets the shotgun to clean it up.  I get it.  I’ve told the joke myself I’m sure.\n\nBut here is the thing, if I’ve done my job right I won’t need a shotgun to keep the boys away from my girls.  They will have the moral strength to handle themselves.\n\nI want my kids to be strong, devoted, determined, different young people.  I know they are going to fail at some point, they are just kids, but I want them to be setup to succeed for the Lord.  I want them to be able to go behind enemy lines and do serious damage to the forces of Satan.\n\nAnd that is our task as parents.  We have got to get serious about raising the right kind of kids.  \n\nListen 20 hours of TV time a week isn’t going to do it.\nJust taking them to church isn’t going to do it.\nWe have got to work every day to capture our children’s hearts and point them to the Lord.",

If my introduction is boring, you probably won’t get much from the rest of the sermon.  If I can get your attention with the introduction, there is at least some chance I can keep it until the end.  So I usually start my sermons with a story, some surprising fact, or by talking about something you might find interesting, and then tie it into the text.  \n\nBut introductions in stories aren’t like introductions in sermons.  They are important for another reason. They have the hard job of helping you get to know the main character of the story.  If you think the main character in a novel is boring after you’ve finished the first chapter, then you probably aren’t going to finish the novel.  \n\nFour people wrote the story of Jesus’ ministry, and three of them (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) started it the same way.  They started it with Jesus getting baptized in the wilderness by John the Baptist, and then it goes right into Him fasting alone in the wilderness for 40 days before being tempted by Satan.\n\nSo obviously, this is important.  If it’s such an important part of the story that it’s the first thing three out of the four writers tell us, then we need to pay special attention to what it says.\n\nIn our text this morning, the book of Mark tells us this story very, very quickly in just two verses.  Look at Mark 1:12-13:\n\n> *”And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.  And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.”*\n\nSee that word “immediately” there.  You are going to see that word a lot in the book of Mark.  Remember: It’s a book of action, and here is the action that Jesus did first. Before He healed anyone and before He preached a single word, He went alone into the wilderness to fast and pray.\n\nNow, we are going to look at this story in Matthew and in Luke before we are done, but I want to go ahead and tell you what we are going to learn from this story.  It’s important.  \n\n* We are going to learn how Jesus lived and what His operating principle was.  \n* We are going to learn why Jesus had to go through a trial and temptation, and \n* We are going to learn how Jesus defeated Satan.\n\nAnd here is the good news: Jesus is our Great Example.  Jesus is the one we are supposed to emulate.  He is our pattern, so...  \n* I’m not just going to teach you **how Jesus lived**; I’m going to teach you **how you can live like Jesus**.  \n* I’m not just going to teach you **why Jesus had trials and temptations**; I’m going to teach you **how you should think about your trials and temptations**. \n* I’m not just going to teach you **how Jesus defeated Satan**; I’m going to teach you **how you can win spiritual victories too**.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll jump right in.**\n\nThe first thing we can learn from this story of Jesus is...\n\n## I. How to live like Jesus lived.\n\nLook at our text again.  It says, *”And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.”*\n\nNow, obviously, that doesn’t mean that Jesus got baptized, came out of the water, looked up and saw the Spirit driving an old Caddy, saying, “Hey Jesus, get in,” and then the Spirit drove the old Caddy to somewhere else in the wilderness and said, “Okay, get out now.”\n\nNo.  *“Driveth him into the wilderness”* means that the Spirit led or pushed Jesus into the wilderness.\n\nThe story in Matthew says, *”Then was Jesus led by the spirit into the wilderness,”* (Matthew 4:1) and the story in Luke says, *”And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.”*\n\nThis is an important detail.  Jesus didn’t just wake up one day and decide he wanted to go fast in the wilderness for forty days.  He was directed to do that by the Holy Spirit.\n\nThis is the first lesson for us from this important story: **If we are going to be like Jesus, then we have to be directed by the Holy Spirit.  We have to let the Holy Spirit lead our life.**\n\nThis is actually very clear in the rest of the Bible.  Romans 8:14 says:\n\n> *For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.”*\n\nGalatians 5:16 says:\n\n> *”Walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.”*\n\nEphesians 5:18 says:\n\n> *”And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;”*\n\nI think all of these are referring to the same thing. They are referring to letting the Holy Spirit direct your life.\n\nIf you are a believer this morning, you have the Holy Spirit living inside of you, and He wants to give you directions.  He wants to lead you.  He’ll speak to you if you’ll listen.\n\nAnd the key to living like Jesus lived is to listen to same Holy Spirit that directed Jesus.\n\nDo you remember that fad in the ‘90s where people would wear the WWJD bracelets?  What would Jesus do?  That’s a great question to think about, and the answer is actually really simple: **Jesus would walk in the Spirit.**  If you are a Christian, then the same Holy Spirit that directed Jesus lives in you and gives you instructions. You need to listen to Him and let Him direct you. \n\nSometimes He leads you through impulses likeHe led Jesus here into the wilderness.  Sometimes the Holy Spirit says clearly, “I want you to do this,” or, “This opportunity is something I’ve ordained for you,” or, “You need to walk across the room and apologize to that person.”  I don’t want to minimize that.\n\nBut most of the time the Holy Spirit speaks through the scriptures.  Remember: The Holy Spirit wrote the scriptures, and when we hide the scriptures in our heart and fill our mind with the scriptures, the Holy Spirit uses that to direct our life and to help us.\n\nSo how do we walk like Jesus walked? We walk in the Spirit.  We see that right from the beginning in the introduction of His ministry.\n\nThe second thing this story teaches us is just as important...\n\n## II. How to think about trials and temptations.\n\nOur text says that Jesus was led into the wilderness for 40 days by the Holy Spirit, and that He was tempted there by Satan.\n\nMatthew and Luke add the detail that He was fasting.  He didn’t eat at all for forty days.  \n\nMy daughter Audrey thinks that if she has to fast for forty *minutes*, it’s trials and temptations.  Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit to go without food for forty *days*.  Remember Jesus was 100% God, but He was also 100% man.  He had a human body just like you and I do, and I don’t think it was any easier for Jesus than it would be for us.  This was an extreme trial. This had to be really, really **hard**.\n\nDo you know that sometimes God leads you into hardships?  There are preachers on TV that will tell you if you are right with God, then you will be healthy, there will be money in the bank, and everything will be hunky-dory.  They are charlatans.  They are liars.  That’s not what the Bible teaches us at all.\n\nThe Bible teaches us that God ordains trials and hardships, and that those hardships build up our endurance and test our faith.  Your faith is like a muscle. The only way that it gets any stronger is if it gets stressed and pushed.  We’ve actually been talking about this in James on Sunday nights. You can go to our website and watch those sermons, and they’ll help you.\n\nWhy does God lead us into trials?  For three reasons:\n\n* Sometimes trials are to **reprove** us.  \n\t\n\tSometimes God puts us in the fire to burn some of the junk out of our lives.  Just like a silversmith would melt down silver to take the dross out, sometimes God heats it up in our lives so we can come forth as gold.\n\n* Sometimes trials are to **improve** us.  \n\t\n\tSometimes God uses the trials to build our spiritual faith muscles, and He stresses us to make us stronger and more complete Christians. \n \n* Sometimes trials are to **approve** us.  \n\n\tSometimes trials are like a test to show where we stand.  Remember Job’s trial?  It was a test.  God allowed it in part because He knew Job would pass the test.\n\nSo God allows trials to reprove, improve, and approve us.  But what about Jesus?  Jesus didn’t need to be reproved.  He was sinless.  He didn’t need to be improved.  He was God.  He didn’t need to be approved.  God had just audibly said, *“This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.”*\n\nSo why would Jesus have to go through trials?  I think Jesus went through trials for two reasons:\n\nFirst, **Jesus went through trials so we could know that He knows what trials and temptations are like**.\n\nHebrews 4:15 says this about Jesus:\n\n> *”For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.”*\n\nListen to me here.  Jesus was really tempted and tried.  I mean, I don’t understand this theologically, but there was a possibility that Jesus could have failed this test.  If it wasn’t a possibility of failure, it wasn’t a trial.  \n\nAnd also, it was hard.  I mean, it was a struggle for Jesus.  He had the same impulses to quit that we would have.  He had to struggle just like we have to struggle.  And the reason is so that we would know that our Savior (our High Priest as Hebrews calls Him) would know what it’s like.  \n\nSo when you are going through a trial and you are praying for help, Jesus knows.  He knows what it’s like to have your heart broken.  He knows what it’s like to really feel like quitting.  He knows what it’s like to feel crushed, burdened, weak, and helpless.  He knows what it’s like to suffer.  He knows, and He cares.\n\nHebrews 2:18 says this about Jesus:\n\n> *”For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.”*\n\nSo Jesus was tried so we would know that He knows what trials and temptations are like, but He was also tried so **we would have a pattern for victory**.\n\n---\n\nWe don’t really see this hear in Mark, so let’s turn to another passage that tells this story and read in Luke.  Turn to Luke 4, and we’ll read verses 1-14:\n\n> *”Luke 4:1-14 (KJV) 1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, 2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. 3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. 4 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. 5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. 7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. 8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: 10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: 11 And in [their] hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. 12 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. 13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.”*\n\nThe last lesson or example that Jesus gives to us in this story is...\n\n## III. How to defeat Satan.\n\n1 Peter 5:8 says:\n\n> *”Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.”*\n\nThe Bible has a lot to say about the devil.  He is a real person; a real creature.  Sometimes he is called “the devil,” which means “slanderer,” and sometimes he is called Satan, which means “the adversary.”  He is a fallen angel who is opposed to God. He wants to ruin God’s plan and will for everything, and he is the ruler of the world system.\n\nHe’s smarter than you, he’s more powerful than you, and he’s been at this for a very, very long time.  \n\nSo how do we defeat the devil?  \n\nChrist gives us an example here in this passage.  Take note of a few things:\n\n### A. You defeat Satan by understanding how he attacks:\n\nThere are a few places in scripture where we see the attacks of the devil.  This is one of them, and the other is in the Garden of Eden where we see him attacking Eve.  In both this passage and in the Garden of Eden story, the devil uses the same tactics.\n\nFirst,\n#### 1. He twists and denies the Word of God.\n\nIn this story, the devil misquotes a lot of scripture.  He twists the meaning of some verses and tries to get Jesus to do something that is contrary to God’s will.  \t\n\nThere is a half-truth to everything that the devil says.  He’s smart like that, but we have to be prepared.  We have to know our Bible well enough to know what is and isn’t a proper reading of the Bible, because there are thousands and thousands of people on the devil’s payroll who know just enough Bible to be dangerous and who will tell you what you want to hear.\n\nSometimes the devil outright denies scripture.  He is the father of lies.  He will say *“Yea, hath God said?”*  He’ll get us to either doubt the word of God or to misunderstand it.  That’s his game.  That’s weapon number one in his arsenal.\n\nThe second consistent method the devil uses is...\n\n#### 2. He reuses the same appeals.\n\nThe devil is no dummy.  The devil has been in the advertising business a lot longer than anyone on Madison Avenue.  He knows how to craft a pitch, but he also knows what works.  He used the same three pitches in the Garden of Eden that he used on Jesus here in the wilderness, and he uses those same pitches on us every day.  \n\n1 John 2:15-16 tells us what those pitches are. They are...\n\n* The lust of the flesh\n* The lust of the eyes\n* The pride of life\n\nPut another way, they are:\n\n* Wanting to experience what God doesn’t want you to experience (the lust of the flesh.)\n* Wanting to have what God doesn’t want you to have (the lust of the eyes)\n* Wanting to be what God doesn’t want you to be (the pride of life)\n\nThe devil presented Jesus with the opportunity of eating when God wanted Him fasting.  That’s the lust of the eyes.  He presented Jesus with the opportunity to have the angels save him publicly and receive their help, which wasn’t God’s will . That’s the lust of the flesh.  He presented Jesus with the opportunity to be worshipped then and there as the ruler of the world if he would just bow to Satan. That’s the pride of life.  \n\nThe same three things, used over and over and over again.  That’s how the devil works.\n\nSo we have to understand how he works if we want to defeat him.  The second thing you have to do to defeat Satan is... \n\n### B. You defeat Satan by focusing on the will of God.\n\nNone of the things Satan presented to Jesus were inherently evil.  Jesus would eat bread again.  Nothing wrong with that.  Jesus would be helped by the angels.  Nothing wrong with that.  Jesus would eventually be worshipped. Nothing wrong with that.  What was wrong was that none of those things were God’s will for Jesus then and there at that time.\n\nJesus was laser-focused on fulfilling the will of God for His life.  He was laser-focused on obedience.  The reason He resisted the devil was because the devil was trying to get Him off course, and to get him to take a shortcut from the will of God.\n\nListen, folks: The devil doesn’t usually tempt you with evil things.  He doesn’t put things before you that are inherently bad.  His goal is to get you to take good things at the wrong time, to get you off course, and to get you to take shortcuts from the will of God.  We have to live consciously seeking and valuing the will of God, or we will fall prey to the devil.\n\nSo if we want to defeat the devil we must know how he operates, and we must focus on the will of God.  One more thing...\n\n### C. You defeat Satan by knowing and living the scriptures.\n\nLook at Luke 4 again.  Look at all the red words there.  Note that Jesus says twice, “It is written,” and then quotes scripture at the devil.  Actually, all three times Jesus spoke in this chapter, He was quoting the Bible.  \n\nKing David said in Psalm 119:11, *”Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.”* \n\nEphesians 6 teaches us that the only offensive weapon in the Christians armor is *”the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.”*  \n\nHebrews 4:12 says…\n> *”The word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword.”* \n\nOur greatest weapon in spiritual warfare, our greatest tool in fighting off the devil, is the Word of God.  \n\nThat’s why I get up here and preach and teach every week.  That’s why we place such a big emphasis on learning what the Bible actually says.   That’s why we encourage you over and over to read the Bible, memorize the Bible, and study the Bible.   That’s why we do Sunday School and Sunday morning and evening services.  **You can’t win the fight against the devil who is trying to devour your life if you aren’t in the scriptures and if the scriptures aren’t in you.**\n\nJesus said in this passage, *”Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God.”* You don’t eat just once a week.  You eat every day; likely several times a day.  You need more spiritual nourishment than a Sunday morning sermon.  You need to be in the word every day.  \n\nThere’s a real devil, folks.  There is a real spiritual warfare going on.  The only way to defeat Him is to know what he’s up to, to follow God’s leading in your life, and to get God’s word in you.\n\n**Let’s stand for invitation and prayer.  Every head bowed, every eye closed.  I want to ask you some questions.**\n\n1. Are you saved?\n2. Are you walking in the Spirit, letting the Holy Spirit lead you day by day?\n3. Are you letting God use the trials of life to strengthen you?\n4. Are you falling for the devil’s schemes?\n5. Are you focused on the will of God?\n6. Are you in the Bible?\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "We’ve finished our little mini-series on evangelism, and I am going to get back to the Psalms eventually, but what I would like to do for a little while is just speak for a few minutes on Wednesday nights on something that popped out to me in my devotions this week.  So for the next, lets say, two months on Wednesday nights, I might talk about anything and we’ll see how that goes.\n\nThis morning I was reading my Bible and I read a passage every day that has nothing to do with what I’m preaching, so right now I’m reading Jeremiah.  Then I read a chapter in Proverbs.  This morning I was reading chapter 13.\n\nProverbs, of course, is a book of wisdom and a lot of it is specifically aimed at young people.  This is a young people sermon tonight.  It’s applicable to everyone, but specifically I want the young people to listen up.\n\nThis is going to be very practical. I’m in a how-to mood.  So I’m titling this little message “How to ruin your life.”\n\nYou see, in Proverbs 13 it tells us three ways that young people (and old people) can ruin their lives.  All I want to do tonight is share those with you so if you were considering it, you would know what to do.\n\nSo if you want to throw your life away - listen up.  If you want to end up in jail or in a gutter somewhere - take some notes.  If you want people to look at your life and say words like: “sad”, “loser”, and “waste of potential” then this message is your message.  Because the Bible tells us exactly how to do that here.\n\n**Before I give you the outline, let’s pray.**\n\nSo you want to throw your life away, you want to be a loser, you want to be a waste and a junkie.  Here is a step by step.  Three things.\n\nThe first one is…\n\n## 1. Choose terrible friends and influences.\n\nLook at verse 20\n\n> *”He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.”*\n\nThere you have it.  *”A companion of fools will be destroyed.”*\n\nIf you want to throw your life away, the Bible has some hot tips.  Here’s a big one - hang out with foolish people.\n\nYou are who you hang out with, so if you are wanting your life to be awful, sinful, wicked, raunchy, and pitiful - start hanging out with people who are awful, sinful, wicked , raunchy or pitiful.\n\nAnd do you know what, modern technology has made this so easy.  You don’t even have to actually go out and find those people anymore.  That’s hard.  No, you can pipe them into your living room with your TV set or load them up on your phone or crank them up on your radio.   Want to be trashy - listen to trash.  Watch trash.  Read trash.  \n\nFill your mind up with all of the garbage of this world and let it just flow all over you.\n\nWhen you do get out and be social, hang out with people who are doing nothing with their life.  Teenagers, you can go find some friends who are halfway to teen pregnancy or halfway to the party and alcohol life and just ride their coattails and they’ll take you right in.\n\nBecause you are what you hang out with.  He that walketh with wise man shall be wise.  So you wouldn’t want to walk with the folks at church.  You wouldn’t want to walk with the wise men of scripture.  You wouldn’t want to get around people who are actually trying to serve God and do something with their life.  It might rub off on you and you might get wise and if you get wise, you might have a blessed life.  \n\nSo pick terrible friends and influences.\n\nBut that’s not the only tip this chapter gives us on how to throw away our lives.  I mean, that one will work all by itself, but this gives us even more terrible, I mean great, advice on how to throw your life away.\n\nThe second tip it gives us is if you want to throw your life away…\n\n## 2. Don’t listen to your parents, teachers and authority figures.\n\nLook at verse 18:\n\n> *”Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.”*\n\nPoverty and shame.  Now we are talking!  \n\nSeriously, all those people always telling you what to do.  All those people getting onto you.  All those people telling you to straighten up.  Just ignore them.  \n\nThey are just out to get you anyways.  They don’t understand.   They are picking on you.\n\nIf you really want to destroy your life you can’t have anyone criticizing you.  Who gave the preacher the right to point out sin?  Who gave your parents the right to tell you you are lazy?  Who gave your teacher the right to push you?  Who gave your boss the right to tell you to work harder or not come in late?  \n\nYou want to through your life away, so you aren’t going to listen to them.  You aren’t going to think about the fact that they probably have seen a lot more than you have.  You aren’t going to think about the fact that they probably care for you and love you very much.  You aren’t going to think about the fact that they have no reason to ruin your life and only want what’s best for you.  You totally aren’t going to think about the fact that they are a gift from God to you.\n\nNo, you want poverty and shame - so you are going to plug your ears and assume that all of those people telling you things you don’t want to hear are out to get you and just being mean.\n\nSo if you want to throw your life away choose terrible friends and don’t listen to the council of your parents and other authority figures.\n\nThere’s another tip here on throwing your life away.\n\n## 3. Ignore God’s commands\n\nLook at verse 15.\n\n> *”Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.”*\n\nA transgressor is someone who breaks God’s laws.  They ignore the things the Bible says you shouldn’t do, and if you want to throw your life away, you should definitely be a transgressor.\n\nBecause you want hard right?  You want poverty.  You want shame.  You want to struggle.  You want to be surrounded by seedy characters.  You want to never have enough and never get a leg up.  You want to always be wondering when your sin will come to light.\n\nSo the Bible.  Bible-shmible.  You don’t need it.  It’s not going to help you throw your life away.  \n\n\n  \n",

    "body": "# James 1:19-20\nYou really need to watch your mouth.\n\nOur text tonight is James 1:19-20, and that is the theme that it introduces: You really need to watch your mouth.\n\nJames is going to come back to this theme several times before this book is over.  He’s even going to give us a whole chapter about it in chapter 3, but he sort of sets it up with an opening shot in verses 19-20, which don’t seem to be related to the previous stuff at all.   \n\nLet’s read those verses:\n\n> *”Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.”*\n\nWatch your mouth.  Check yourself before you wreck yourself.   Be careful, little mouths, what you say.  \n\nThat’s the main idea here, and it’s a thoroughly biblical idea.  You have to be super careful what you say and how you say it.\n\nLet’s start this evening by going to the book of Proverbs, and we’ll just look and see what Proverbs has to say about this.  Go to Proverbs 17 first; look at verse 27:\n\n> *”Proverbs 17:27 (KJV) He that hath knowledge spareth his words: [and] a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.”*\n\nLook at the next verse:\n\n> *”Proverbs 17:28 (KJV) Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: [and] he that shutteth his lips [is esteemed] a man of understanding.”*\n\nSpare your words, shut your lips, hold your peace.  You’ll show your knowledge, you’ll be counted wise, you’ll be esteemed a man of understanding.  Not by what you say, but by what you DON’T say.\n\nIt’s like that old Ronald Reagan quote:\n\n> It’s better to keep quiet and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.\n\nLet’s look at a few more proverbs:\n\nProverbs 10:19\n\n> *”Proverbs 10:19 (KJV) In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips [is] wise.”*\n\nWant to sin? Start talking.  Want to be wise? Shut your mouth.\n\nProverbs 13:3\n\n> *”Proverbs 13:3 (KJV) He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: [but] he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.”*\n\nWant to destroy yourself? Be a blabbermouth.  Want to keep and protect your life? Be careful what you say.\n\nWe could read several more proverbs like this—proverbs about being careful with what you say—but let’s go back to James and consider what he had to say in our text tonight.  Look again at James 1:19-20.\n\n> *”James 1:19-20 (KJV) 19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: 20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.”*\n\nJames is making three points in these two verses—three very practical and very painful points that you can put into practice tonight.  Let’s pray and ask God’s blessing tonight, and we’ll jump right into those three points.\n\n**Pray**\n\nThe first point James was making in these two verses was:\n\n## 1. We should actually *listen* to what other people are saying.\n\nMost people are terrible listeners.  Most people hear this when other people are talking to them:\n\n> “Blah, blah, blah.” When is it my time to talk?  When are you going to say something that I can jump in on?  Enough about you; let me speak up.\n\nBut James says we need to be *”swift to hear.”*  Hurry to hear. Put the brakes on before you talk.\n\nThat means that we listen.  That we try to understand *their* viewpoint.  Try to really understand what *they* are saying.\n\nThis is a skill. It’s something you have to work at and develop.  \n\nMost of us are so arrogant, we want to rush to fix things before we know what those things actually are.  We have to slow down to think and hear.\n\nListening is an act of selflessness.  It’s putting “me” aside for a minute and focusing on you.\n\nSometimes that means we nod; we repeat back what people say; we make eye contact; we pay attention to body language.  \n\nWe’ve all been on the other end.  We’ve all been talking to someone who cut us off to say what was on their mind. We’ve all had the feeling that the person we are talking to just isn’t interested.\n\nWe’ve got to work at this.  Can I tell you? **I have to work at this.**  I have to work at this with my wife and my children.  Sometimes my mind can be going a million miles an hour while Amanda is trying to tell me about her day or about something she heard, and I’m like, “Uh huh. Yes, honey. Whatever you say, honey.” Between the lines, what I’m saying is, “I don’t really care. You aren’t that important to me right now,” and I do it way, way too much.\n\nThe kids will be trying to tell me something that is really important while my mind is in a book or in some problem, and I blow them off.  \n\nThere is an old quote that I believe is true: \n\n> **People don’t care what you know until they know that you care.**\n\nOne of the ways we show that we care is just by listening.  I need to work on this,  we probably all need to work on this.\n\nWe have this tendency to judge other people before we listen to their side of things and before we see things through there eyes.  A lot of our criticisms would go away if we had to walk a mile in other people’s shoes.\n\nWe need to be *“swift to hear.”* The second main point James is making in these verses is...\n\n## 2. We need to check our impulse to talk before we listen.\n\nHe says, *Be swift to hear, slow to speak.*\n\nWe need to listen more than we talk, and we need to listen before we talk.  \n\nOne of my favorite wisdom books is James Covey’s *7 Habits Of Highly Effective People*.   It’s not a Christian book, but it’s dripping with wisdom that matches up with the Bible and I highly recommend it.  One of those habits is:\n\n> Seek to understand before you seek to be understood.\n\nLet me read you this amazing illustration from that chapter:\n\n> Suppose you’ve been having trouble with your eyes and you decide to go to an optometrist for help.  After briefly listening to your complaint, he takes off his glasses and gives them to you.  \n> “Put these on,” he says.  “I’ve worn this pair of glasses for ten years now and they’ve really helped me.  I have an extra pair at home; you can wear these.”\n> So you put them on, but it only makes the problem worse.\n> “This is terrible!” You exclaim.  “I can’t see a thing!”\n> “Well, what’s wrong?”  He asks. “They work great for me.  Try harder.”\n> “I am trying,” you insist.  “Everything is a blur.”\n> “Well, what’s the matter with you?  Think positively.”\n> “Okay. I positively can’t see a thing.”\n> “Boy, are you ungrateful!” He chides.  “After all I’ve done to help you!”\n> How many of you would go back to that optometrist next time you needed help?  You don’t have much confidence in someone who doesn’t diagnose before he or she prescribes.\n> But how often do we diagnose before we prescribe in communication?\n\nYou might laugh at that, but I’ve been a part of many conversations that are like that.  Someone isn’t listening, and they are just trying to shove a one-size-fits-all opinion down the other person’s throat.  We repeat these christian cliches thoughtlessly.  What’s sad is that often they don’t even realize they are doing it and that they are being hurtful.\n\nWhy do we talk before we listen?\n\n* Sometimes we do it because we like the sound of our own voice.  \n* Sometimes we do it because we want to feel important.\n* Sometimes we do it because we want to show off our knowledge.\n* Sometimes we do it because we want to score some kind of argument points.\n* Sometimes we do it because we want to “win.”\n\nFor whatever reason we do it, it’s always a form a selfishness, and it’s almost never helpful.\n\nThis is the way that almost all political conversations go nowadays.  Democrats aren’t listening to Republicans.  Republicans aren’t listening to Democrats.  If they have any kind of conversation at all, it’s a social media game where one group is trying to one-up the other.  They aren’t arguing with each other’s points. Republicans never say, “You know, that’s a good point. We do need to show more compassion to the poor who were born into this stuff.”  Democrats never say, “I can totally understand why you would be so against abortion.  If I thought abortion was murder, I’d be against it, too.”  They aren’t ever listening to each other.  They aren’t talking WITH each other. They are talking AT each other.\n\nIt’s a complete waste of time, and unfortunately, many times we do that same kind of thing in any kind of conversation with our friends and our coworkers.  We aren’t really listening to them.  We are just waiting for our time to talk.  When we do talk, we aren’t really addressing what they say. We are just serving up some cute zinger or phrase we heard.\n\nIt’s not helpful. \n\nIf you want to win people, you have to listen to people and hear and understand the point they are making.  \n\nDo you know what a straw man is?  Its arguing with a point no one is making.  90% of arguments are just straw men.  \n\nBut when we listen.  When we actually try to hear what people are saying instead of jumping on them and when we deal with their best points fairly.  Then we have a chance to change people’s minds.\n\nWe need to be swift to hear, slow to speak.  We need to actually listen to people, we need to check our impulse to talk too soon.\n\nOne more point here...    \n\n## 3. We need to realize that losing our temper never advances God’s will.\nJames says:\n\n> *”...swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.”*\n\nSelfish anger and self-righteous anger never help anybody.\n\nThere is a kind of anger that is holy anger.  It’s okay to be angry at sin.  It’s okay to be angry because others are being hurt.  It’s okay to be angry for others.\n\nSometimes I see the direction that young people are going, and it makes me angry—not angry at them, but angry for them.  There is a big difference there.\n\nBut most of the time when we get angry and we lose our temper, it’s not anger for others; it’s anger for ourself.  Our ego got trampled.  Our pride got knocked a blow.  We didn’t get what we wanted or expected.  Things are an inconvenience to us.\n\nThat kind of anger is never, ever helpful.  Let’s be honest: Most of the time I’m angry with my kids, it’s not because I’m angry **for** them. It’s because they are annoying **me** or inconveniencing **me**.  \n\nThat’s selfish anger.  It’s never helpful.\n\nBut there is also self-righteous anger.  \n\nRemember the story of the woman taken in adultery.  The Pharisees were gathered around this woman, angry and ready to stone her to death.  She’d been taken in adultery, in the very act.  \n\nAnd these men were ready to stone her because they hated sin, right?  Nope, they were doing it because it made them feel better about themselves.  It was self-righteous in another way.  It’s **virtue signaling.**\n\nWe see this in Hollywood all the time now.  Everyone has to get up and give their speech showing their anger at the latest thing-to-be-angry-about.  Why?  It’s virtue signaling.  They are showing how good they are by showing how angry they are at other people’s sins.\n\nA lot of angry preaching is like this.  I could preach hard and heavy against a bunch of sins and probably make some people very happy; probably get some amens; probably increase the views on the YouTube channel.  But if no one in the room is struggling with those sins, all we are doing is virtue signaling. We are showing self-righteous anger.\n\nWe saw this in Sunday school this morning.  Simon the Pharisee showed self-righteous anger.\n\nSlow down.  Check yourself.  Your selfish anger and your self-righteous anger is not helping God’s cause.  It’s not advancing God’s will.\n\n> *”the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.”*\n\nLet me close with one Bible illustration.  You might remember this from Sunday School a couple of months ago.  There is this story in Joshua 22.\n\nJoshua is dividing up the land, and two and a half of the twelve tribes are going to be on the east side of Jordan.   They are geographically separated from the rest of Israel and from the tabernacle.\n\nSo in Joshua 22, they build an altar on the east side of Jordan right next to the river.\n\nWhen the other nine and a half tribes see this altar, they get mad.  They immediately start to get an army together to go wipe out the two and a half eastern tribes.  They assume that they were compromising.  They assume that they were worshipping other gods and trying to replace the tabernacle.  They weren’t going to put up with it.  \n\nThousands of their countrymen were going to die.  It was going to be a righteous civil war.  \n\nBut someone had the good sense to send someone over there to actually ask about the altar, and when they did, they realized they had the wrong impression.  They weren’t trying to replace the tabernacle. This wasn’t that kind of altar.  It was actually a good thing.\n\nImagine how many innocent lives would have been lost had they not listened and been slow to wrath.  It would have been incredibly sad and tragic.\n\nChurch, we’ve got to watch our tongue.  We’ve got to check our anger.  We have to get the whole story.  We have to try to understand the other person’s perspective.  If we go to the warpath right away, we are going to shed unnecessary blood.  We aren’t going to advance God’s cause at all that way.\n\nThink about the word “communicate” with me for a minute.  Communicate comes from the word “common.”  The heart of communication is sharing.  It’s a give and take.\n\nThe problem is, our communication becomes all give and no take.  Or if you look at it another way, all take and no give.  \n\nListen, when we fail to communicate - it just brings problems.  We don’t reach people.  We go to war on misconceptions.  We turn people away.  Because we don’t listen. Then we justify it with selfish anger and self-righteous anger.\n\nI think there are a lot of people who would be in church who aren’t because we didn’t listen.  I think our country would be a lot better if we would stop throwing rhetorical bombs at each other and we listened and actually had a conversation with each other for once.  \n\nSo let’s listen.  Let’s communicate.  Let’s realize that our anger helps nothing.  It helps no one.  It’s just a form of virtue signaling.  It’s not advancing God’s will at all.",

    "body": "We are going to look this morning at the beginning of Acts 21. Acts 21.\n\nThere is a film coming out this weekend called Hacksaw Ridge. I haven't seen it. I'm probably not going to see it. But the story of it is fascinating. It tells the true story of this man named Desmond Doss, who won the congressional medal of honor in world war 2. Doss was a Christian. When he was a boy, his dad got in a drunken fight with his brother in law and almost killed him. Desmond made a vow to God never to kill or even touch a weapon.\n\nOf course, this was a problem in World War 2, and so Desmond was labeled a \"conscientious objector\" even though he was granted a draft deferment and had volunteered. He wasn't against the war. He actually volunteered. He just had vowed never to touch a gun. He was made a medic and was treated horribly by his fellow soldiers.\n\nHe was a seventh day adventist and he took the sabbath literally, and he was hated for that. His fellow soldiers were allowed to do anything to him. They even tried to section 8 him and kick him out of the unit.\n\nBut at the battle of Okinawa, Desmond Doss went unarmed into one of the worst killing fields in history, when everyone else was retreating, he was going in. Over 12 hours, he went into the mayhem and brought men out. It was a suicide mission. Bombs and mortars everywhere. He went in by himself and saved 75 men. 75.\n\nOne of those men was one of the leaders who tried to get him kicked out as crazy.\n\nIn another battle, he was hit with a grenade in the legs. He sat for 5 hours before other medics came to save with litter. On his way back he saw a man who was hit. He rolled off the litter and demanded that the other medics carry him back instead. While he lay there he was shot by a Japanese sniper.\n\nHe was the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor.\n\nIt's a powerful true story. It begs a question: why in the world would a person push forward into almost certain death. Why would someone put himself in the position to be abused? Put himself in the position to be shot? Put others above himself. Why would he run towards the machine gun bullets while everyone else was running away?\n\nWhat makes people go forward in the face of danger?\n\nThat is what our passage is about today. In our passage, the Apostle Paul is moving towards Jerusalem. All along the way, godly spiritual people are telling him he's going to get hurt there and begging him not to go. Yet Paul tells them he must go anyways because it's God's will for him.\n\nSo let's read the passage. Acts 21:1-15 and then we'll pray and I'll give you an outline.\n\n\"1 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the [day] following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 2 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth. 3 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden. 4 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. 5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till [we were] out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed. 6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again. 7 And when we had finished [our] course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day. 8 And the next [day] we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was [one] of the seven; and abode with him. 9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy. 10 And as we tarried [there] many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus. 11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver [him] into the hands of the Gentiles. 12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem. 13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. 15 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem.\"\n\nOk. Let's pray.\n\nI'm going to give you three points this morning on this passage. I think there are three things we can learn from how the people in this story acted. How Paul acted. Every one of those things is applicable for us today.\n\nThe first thing I want you to notice is...\n\n1. Paul's Counselors\nNotice in this passage as Paul moves through this story - travelling west to east from Greece to Jerusalem, that a certain pattern emerges. Everywhere Paul goes, he finds Christians, he finds a church, and he has intimate fellowship with him.\n\nHe starts in Miletus, where he is meeting with church leaders. Then they sail all the way across the Mediteranean to Syria and they land in the great city of Tyre, which is in modern day Lebanon, and the Bible says they find a bunch of believers there and they \"tarried there seven days\". They find these believers they didn't know and the stay seven days with them.\n\nDuring this week, some of these people beg Paul not to go to Jerusalem. At the end of the week, they all take their families and go to the beach and they have a little farewell prayer meeting. An emotional goodbye to friends they only met a week before.\n\nThen Paul continues his journey and ends up in Caesarea. He ends up in the house of Phillip, one of the original deacons and evangelists and he fellowships with Phillip and Phillips daughters for awhile.\n\nThen this guy Agabus comes and does this little spiritual show and tell where he takes Paul's belt and wraps it around his arms and legs and says \"The person who owns this belt is going to end up like this in Jerusalem.\"\n\nFinally, in verse 12 the whole crew begs Paul not to go to Jerusalem.\n\nSo here is what I want you to see about the characters in our story this morning: Two Things are obvious in this story.\n\nFirst, it's obvious that Paul was always developing these deep relationships with his spiritual brothers and sisters in the church.\nI mean, everywhere he goes, he's finding believers and he's fellowshipping with them. He's going over there house. He's spending time with them. He's eating at their kitchen tables.\n\nWhat we don't see in this story is this kind of cold, professional church where its just \"see you next Sunday.\" No. Even when Paul was a stranger in a new town he sought out believers and he fellowshipped with them.\n\nI want you to turn with me to Romans 12. Romans 12. Famous passage. The \"Present your bodies a living sacrifice passage.\" The \"You are members one of another passage.\" But we are going to look at another part. Look at verses 9-16 with me. Remember, this is describing how we should act in the church.\n\n[Rom 12:9-16 KJV] 9 [Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good. 10 [Be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another; 11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 12 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; 13 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. 14 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. 15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. 16 [Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.\n\nNotice the description of how our church relationships are supposed to be. Obvious love. Obvious care for each other. Striving together for the same goal. Sharing in each other's hopes and dreams and pain and disappointments. Everywhere you look in the New Testament this is what you see. You see this intimate fellowship.\n\nYou see folks, here is what I want you to understand about church. Church was never intended to be this place where you just come once or twice a week and hear a message. Church was intended to be your second family. The people you live you life with, you share your dreams with.\n\nWe call it a \"church family\" for a reason. It should feel like a family. That's what we see here.\n\nBut the second thing we see here is that\n\nit's obvious that those people had license to speak into Paul's life.\nRemember, almost everyone in this story is strangers. These are people Paul has known for less than a week or just a couple of weeks. Yet they are begging Paul not to go to Jerusalem. Over and over we see this. They were speaking into Paul's life and Paul's plans.\n\nAnd here is the lesson for us church. I think we are very, very far from this in most modern churches. Church is something we do, but in the Bible Church was something they were a part of. Church was who they were. Church was their family.\n\nI think you should have friends and family all over. I think you should get to know lots of people. Lost people. People in other churches. Whoever. But listen, I think there should be a special bond with God's people, with a church family and I think you should expect those people to speak into your life.\n\nLook at one more passage with me. This is a pastors favorite passage. Look at Hebrews 10:25\n\n\"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; \"\n\nPastors like this verse because it says you should go to church. Don't forsake the assembling of yourselves. But notice what almost no one ever talks about. Notice the next phrase:\n\n\"...but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.\"\n\nNotice, the reason why we are to \"not forsake the assembling\" is so that we can be \"exhorting one another.\"\n\nPaul's counselors were his Christian family. Who are you getting your counsel from? If some dear old lady in our church or some faithful Christian man came to you in love and said \"I don't think you should do that\" how would you handle it?\n\nSo we see Paul's counselors. Second we see...\n\n2. Paul's Commission\nThe heart of this story is found in verse in verse 13\n\n\"Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\"\n\nPaul's course was set. He knew what his orders were. He knew what God's will was for him and he wasn't moving off of it.\n\nNotice what the church's answer was in verse 14\n\n\"The will of the Lord Be Done\"\n\nOk, Paul, if that is God's will - so be it.\n\nHow could Paul be so brave? How could he go headfirst into danger? I mean, people, before this passage is over he's going to be having his head beaten by a mob in the Temple. How could he do that?\n\nHe lived with a purpose\nI think the answer is that he lived with a purpose. He lived with a mission that was bigger than himself and bigger than his comfort. In Romans, which Paul wrote just before this story, Paul said this:\n\n\"Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company. But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.\" (Romans 15:24-27)\n\nPaul knew God wanted him to go to Jerusalem and he had plans after that. He was going to go to Rome and go to Spain. He was fulfilling God's will for him.\n\nThe reason why this seems so strange to so many Christians is so many Christians aren't living for a mission. There mission is to spend as much time on the fishing boat as possible. There mission is to get to bed before 11pm. There mission is get some new threads at the mall. They live completely self-absorbed lives and when you live a completely self-absorbed life the notion of sacrifice or putting yourself in harms way seems strange.\n\nListen, folks, what is your mission? What is the thing God has given you to do? Have you thought about it? Have you prayed about it? Are you living for it? Are you sacrificing for it?\n\nWhen you have a mission - when you have your marching orders and you know they come from God - it makes it easy to sacrifice. Some decisions are made for you.\n\nThe amazing thing about that Desmond Doss story I told you about wasn't that Desmond Doss rushed headlong into danger to save people. It's that he made decisions every day for years that put him in danger and caused him scorn. His mission was living for Jesus, being a witness for him, and he didn't care.\n\nThe point here is that Paul lived for something bigger than himself. So the question is what are you living for?\n\nOne more point and it will be a quick one:\n\n3. Paul's Compulsion\nWhat made Paul do this? What was behind this? Look at the last phrase of verse 13:\n\nfor the name of the Lord Jesus.\n\nHe was doing it out of a love for God. That was the driving principle of his life. Turn with me to Philippians 3 and we'll close. Look at verse 15. This is Paul's compulsion. This is what was driving him:\n\n\"That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;\"\n\nPaul lived for a desire to please God and know Him better. He wanted to be like Jesus.\nDo you know that's the heart of being a Christian - being like Jesus. That's literally what Christian means. Little Christ. Like Jesus.\n\nDid you know Jesus didn't have a cush life? People didn't always treat him well. He too had people he loved warning him not to go to Jerusalem and He went anyways.\n\nAll Paul wanted to do was be like Jesus - whatever that cost him.",

    "body": "Identifying a Good Friend\n\nThe subject of friendship is very important. You will be like who you hang around, so it’s important that we hang around the right kind of people. It’s also important that we learn how to be the right kind of friend, so this lesson goes both ways. We can learn how to find the right kind of friend, and how to be the right kind of friend. You will not get what you want; you will get what you are. There’s an old saying: “Water finds its own level.” In other words, you will naturally gravitate toward people who are like you, people you find you have things in common with. That’s how it is when you go to a new school or when we go to camp. You end up making friends with people who are on your level. \n\nWhenever you need practical advice from the Bible, the book of Proverbs is one of the best places to go. There are several verses about friends in this book, and we’re going to take a look at what we can learn from them. These principles will also extend to your dating relationships, so even though many of you are several years away from when you should even consider dating, I will give you a few principles for dating as well so you can have them when you eventually need them. I’m just a nice guy like that.\n\n1. A Good Friend Keeps You Out of Trouble (Prov. 6:1-3) – [Explain what “surety” is] I’ve seen this saying sometimes on TV shows, comedy routines, and even images people share on Facebook: “A good friend will bail you out of jail when you get in trouble. A great friend will be in jail with you talking about how awesome that was.” That’s total nonsense. A true friend will keep you from getting in trouble in the first place. Despite what the world may teach you, you can have fun with your friends without doing anything illegal or without getting drunk or high, which can lead you to do something illegal. I talk to people at work who don’t seem to know how to have fun if they’re not drunk or high, and that’s really sad. \n\nIf you hang around people who try to tempt you to do those things or anything you know you shouldn’t do, then you need to get away from them. There were certain people in school that I noticed I got in trouble more when I was with them. That’s not the kind of friend you need to have. This also extends to your dating relationships. If a guy or girl starts making sexual advances on you, even if all they do is talk about it, then you don’t need to have anything to do with that guy or girl. If that’s what’s on their mind now, then it’s not going to lead to anything good for you later. \n\n2. A Good Friend is Willing to Forgive (Prov. 17:9) – No matter how close you are, every friendship goes through rough patches. There are no “And they lived happily ever after with no problems ever” relationships, whether we’re talking family, friends, or dating. How you react when problems arise in your relationships says a lot about you. Do you try to get things fixed as quickly as you can, or do you go to another friend and talk about them behind their back? \n\nBe careful about the kind of friend who is constantly talking bad about their other friends to you. If they’re talking about their other friends to you behind their backs, they’re probably doing the same to you. \n\n3. A Good Friend Loves at All Times (Prov. 17:17) – This one is pretty straightforward. A good friend is there for you when things are good, and a good friend is there for you when things are bad. Loyalty and commitment are quickly becoming forgotten concepts in our world today because people are so self-centered nowadays. The friendship is all about them, not the other person. Whenever a friend of yours is going through a hard time, you need to be there for them. It’s a good opportunity to talk about the Lord with them, especially if that friend is not saved. People’s hearts get more tender and receptive when they’re hurting, and they want to know they have someone who cares about them. \n\nNo friendship is perfect. There are going to be times when you don’t get along and you argue with each other. You need to be willing to take the initiative to get things right. Forgive them, and ask them to forgive you. At the same time, if you have a friend that you just never seem to get along with and all you do is fight and snipe at each other behind each other’s backs, then you might want to consider why you’re friends with that person in the first place and see if anything needs to change. \n\n4. A Good Friend is Approachable (Prov. 18:24) – To tell you the truth, I used to hate this verse. That may be bad to say, but I kinda did. I’m a shy person, and I’m not good at meeting new people. When I was in school, I used to wonder why I didn’t have more friends. Then my mom or someone else would quote this verse, and I’d get so mad. You should be the kind of person people want to be around. You may not be friends with everyone, but you should always be friendly. It will be a good testimony for you as a Christian, and it will open up opportunities for you to be a witness to others. You should not be the person at your school who has the bad reputation. It will not only make it difficult for you to be a good witness to others, but it brings shame to the name of Christ if that reputation is deserved. \n\nThe Bible says in Matthew 5:13-16 that we are to be a salt and a light to this world. Those are pleasant things. You should be a pleasant person to be around. Nobody likes being around the grumpy guy or the sad sack. To be honest, I still struggle with this sometimes. It’s part of being an introvert, as I’m sure some of you know, but we have to be willing to get out of our shells and step outside our comfort zones at times if we are going to be the witness for Christ that we need to be. \n\n5. A Good Friend is Willing to Hurt You to Help You (Prov. 27:6) – This is a tough one. First of all, understand that this verse is not an excuse for you to say mean things to someone or hurt someone’s feelings. You shouldn’t be the kind of person who constantly berates or belittles their friends, and you shouldn’t hang around that kind of person. You definitely shouldn’t date that kind of person because that can become a vicious cycle where they are cruel to you. Then they say, “I’m sorry. It’ll never happen again,” and then it keeps happening because they’re not really sorry. If a guy doesn’t treat you with respect at all times, get away from him. Don’t have anything to do with him. \n\nAnyway, what this verse is talking about is that a good friend is someone who will tell you when you’re doing wrong because they want you to do right. Sometimes that involves hurting someone because you have to tell someone something they don’t want to hear. I’ve had friends confront me when I wasn’t doing right, and it’s not fun. It’s not fun to have to be the friend that does the confronting either, but if you really care about each other, you’ll do it. It will take a lot of courage, and if you have a friend who is willing to call you out on your sin, hang on to that friend for dear life. That friend is a keeper. \n\nIt reminds me of when King David committed adultery with Bathsheba, and Nathan the prophet called him out on it. Yes, Nathan was a prophet who had a message from God to deliver, but he was also David’s friend. The reason Nathan confronted David about his sin was because he wanted David to confess his sin and get right with God. That should always be the goal: To get right with God first and foremost, and then with each other. \n\n6. A Good Friend Encourages You to Be a Better Christian (Prov. 27:9) – This verse talks about having a friend who gives good advice. Good advice is always advice that encourages you to be a better Christian. If you have friends who try to get you to do wrong when you ask for their advice, those people are not your friends. If they try to get you to go around behind your parents’ backs to go do something you know your parents would not approve of, those people are not your friends. If your parents tell you they don’t think you should hang around with that person, then don’t go behind their backs and hang out with that person. As an aside, you should never, ever date someone your parents don’t approve of. \n\nThat is a pretty simple question you can ask of any friendship: Does being friends with this person help me as a Christian or hurt me? Does dating this person help me as a Christian or hurt me? Now in some cases, you can turn a hurtful friendship into a helpful friendship if you are two Christians who both realize they haven’t been helping each other and are willing to change that. Regardless, a good friend helps you be a good Christian [Share story about Cynthia asking me for advice in college].\n\n7. A Good Friend is There When You Need Them (Prov. 27:10) – This verse is commending a close friend, not criticizing a distant brother. It’s just a fact of life that when you grow up, sometimes you grow apart in terms of distance. People go off to different colleges. They move to different places for work. This is why people tell you that you’ll miss school when it’s over. When you’re in school, you get to see your friends nearly every day. Once school’s over, that’s not always the case. I have friends literally all over the world now who are serving the Lord as missionaries that I may never see in person again. Now the internet, Skype, Facebook, etc. have made it much easier to keep up with what people are doing, even if they aren’t close by, but the Bible here is talking about the importance of having someone you know you can go to when things are bad. You should be that kind of friend to others as well. If you have a friend who is only around when things are good, that’s not a good friend. If that friend is there when things are fun, but they disappear the moment you get in trouble, that’s not a good friend.\n\nThe point is that we all need people we can confide in when we’re hurting. That should be your parents first and foremost, but you need friends like that, too. \n\n8. A Good Friend Puts Others First (Prov. 27:14) – How many of you here are morning people? I want you to take a good look at this verse and memorize it. I am not a morning person. One of the benefits of working nights is that I sleep all morning, so I only have to deal with morning people on Sundays. Anyway, this verse sounds strange, and you may be wondering what it’s even talking about. The implication in this verse from what I could tell from studying it out is that the person in this verse is being insincere and flattering. He is being Pharisaical, being loud and drawing attention to himself so that people around him will see what a good friend he is. It could also mean that he is saying a bunch of nice things to flatter the other person to get them to do something for him. \n\nIn either case, this person is being a selfish friend. He has made the friendship all about him. He is a friend who is interested in getting, not giving. The friendship must be on his terms. When it’s inconvenient for him, he’s not interested. You only hang out when he wants to hang out. You only do what he wants to do. He is constantly asking for favors but is unwilling to do any favors for you. Don’t be that kind of friend, and don’t have that kind of friend. That kind of person is just trying to take advantage of people for his own gain, and he will only be around when there’s something in it for him. \n\nYou also need to beware of this type of person in your dating relationships. This is the kind of person who shamelessly flirts with you and a million other people, but they’re not flirting because they’re interested in you. They are interested in what they can get out of you to boost their own ego. Once they get what they want, they’ll be gone. Don’t be this kind of person to the opposite sex either. There are people who flirt to try to get someone to like them, but they aren’t actually interested in them at all. They just like the attention and the ego boost they get from it. The point is, don’t flirt with someone you’re not actually interested in dating. You may think it’s just “playful,” but it’s insincere and, more often than not, someone’s feelings get hurt because of it. \n\n9. A Good Friend Understands the Importance of Influence (Prov. 27:17) – This goes back to what I said at the beginning. You will be like who you hang around, either for good or for bad. You need to hang around people who are going to help you be a better Christian, and you also need to be the kind of friend who helps those around them be better Christians as well. \n\nYou may be listening to all of this, and you may be thinking about some of the friendships you have. You may realize that something in one of those friendships needs to change. That’s a hard place to be in, I understand. It can be kind of scary to talk about those kinds of things because you’re afraid of how they might react. You need to ask God for the courage to do what needs to be done, even if it means you can’t be good friends anymore. Ask God to give you the courage to say no when they ask you to do something you know you shouldn’t do. If you are doing your best to do what’s right, the Lord will be with you and work things out for the best.",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me and turn to the book of Mark.  Mark 1.\n\nThis morning, I’m going to start something that may take me years to finish: I’m going to do a series through the book of Mark.  \n\nMy very first Sunday as pastor here, almost seven years ago, I started preaching in Matthew 1:1.  It took me more than two years to get through the book of Matthew.  I don’t think it will take two years to get through Mark, but I know it’s going to take a long time.\n\nThis morning, we are just going to take 1 verse as our text:  Mark 1:1\n\n> *”The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.”*\n\nMy goal this morning is to give you a **foundation** for the book of Mark.  This is going to be more of a lesson than a sermon, but it’s important for us as we go forward through the book to understand a few things about it.\n\nSpecifically, there are **four** things I want us to understand this morning about this book:\n\n1. I want us to understand the **unique nature** of the book of Mark.\n2. I want us to understand who the **human penman** of the book of Mark was.\n3. I want us to understand the **Divine Subject** of the book of Mark.\n4. I want us to understand the **important purpose** of the book of Mark.\n\nLet’s pray and ask the Lord to bless the word this morning, and we’ll jump right in.\n\n> Heavenly Father, I ask you as we prepare to go through this book of Mark, that you would use this book to speak to us and to change us.  You’ve promised us that your word is powerful and able to divide our thoughts and intentions.  You’ve told us that all of your Word is profitable for our lives and that your Word can make us perfect and thoroughly furnished to do your work.  As we begin the gospel of Mark this morning, may you do a work in our hearts, may you prepare us to better serve you.  We ask this in Jesus’ name, Amen.\n\nAs I said, there are four things I want you to learn this morning about the book of Mark that are going to be important going forward.  The first thing I want us to talk about is...\n\n## 1. I want us to understand the **unique nature** of the book of Mark.\n\nIf you’ve ever read the New Testament, the very first thing you probably noticed is that there are these **four books**—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John—that **are all telling the same story**.  They are all telling the story of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection.  And that begs the questions: **Why do we need four?**\n\nI think there are two reasons we have four gospels: \n\nThe first reason is so we get to view the life of Jesus from **different angles**.  If you were a detective and you were trying to figure out what happened at a crime, you wouldn’t just want **one witness**.  You’d take down **several witness** accounts and piece them together to get a full picture of what happened.  God gives us four witnesses of Jesus—four gospels—so we can get a fuller picture of who Jesus was.\n\nThe second reason why we get four gospels is because **they are written for four different types of people.**  \n\n* The book of Matthew is distinctively Jewish and presents Jesus from a very Jewish perspective.  It’s got a lot of things that have to do with the Jewish religion in it.  In Matthew, Jesus is the Lion of Judah.  \n* The book of Luke, on the other hand, doesn’t say much about the Jewish religion.  Luke is very erudite and full of Jesus’ teaching, and it presents Jesus as the perfect man.  It seems to be written for the Greeks.   \n* John is a transcendent book that presents Jesus as the eagle. The whole purpose of John is to teach salvation and get us to believe the gospel.  \n\nAnd that leaves Mark.  What is the angle of the book of Mark?\n\nWell, let me tell you a few unique things about this book.\n\n* **First, it’s the shortest of the gospels.**  It’s about half as long as the other gospel records, and it skips a lot of content.  No origin story.  No genealogy.  It just goes right into Jesus’ life.\n* **Second, Mark focuses on the ACTS of Jesus and not the teaching of Jesus.**  Mark doesn’t have a lot of dialogue.  It’s just “Jesus did this and then Jesus did that.”    In fact, the key words in the book of Mark are “immediately” and “straightway,” which occur over 40 times in this book.  \n\nI like to call the book of Mark “the Cliff Notes Gospel.”  You know what “Cliff Notes” are right?  When you are in school and you get assigned some massive book to read like *War and Peace* or something like that., you can go buy the Cliff Notes and get the summary without a bunch of the dialogue.  You just get the main points.\n\n**Mark gets right to the point.**  It presents Jesus as a servant and as a doer.  It talks a lot about Jesus’ miracles and His actions.  If Luke was written to the learned Greeks and Matthew was written to the religious Jews, Mark was written to the action-oriented Romans.\n\nThere is an old saying that goes, **“Those who can, do. Those who can’t, teach.”**  Well, Jesus was the greatest teacher who ever lived, but He was also the greatest doer. There is nowhere we see that more clearly than in the book of Mark.\n\nSo the first thing is the unique nature of this book; it is a book of doing.  The second thing I want us to understand by way of introduction this morning is...\n\n\n## 2. I want us to understand who the **human penman** of the book of Mark was.\n\n**Every book of the Bible was ultimately written by the Holy Spirit.**  The words on the wall here remind us that *”All scripture is given by inspiration of God.”* 1 Peter 1 tells us that *”Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”* The author of the Bible is the Holy Spirit. **You can have confidence that when you read the Bible you are reading the very word of God!**\n\nEven though the Holy Spirit is the author, the Holy Spirit spoke through human writers and used their personalities.  Each book was co-written by someone, and this book was co-written by Mark.\n\nRemember Mark? He was one of the twelve disciples.  Matthew, Peter, John, James, Judas, Simon, Mark.  Right?\n\nJust kidding.  Seeing if you are on your toes.  No, Mark wasn’t one of the disciples.  So who was he?  This is actually really encouraging.\n\nIn the book of Acts, we first see Mark when it talks about his mom.  His mother’s name was Mary, and she was a wealthy woman in Jerusalem who hosted a lot of the people in the early church.  When Peter was miraculously released from prison in Acts 12, the place where everyone was praying was Mary the mother of Mark’s house.\n\nMark was also the nephew of Barnabas.  Remember Barnabas?   **Paul and Barnabas.**  He was the guy who mentored Paul and went on the first missionary journey with him.  That is the second place we see Mark in the Bible, because when Paul and Barnabas went on their first missionary journey, they decided to take Mark with them.\n\n**It was a scandal.**  Mark didn’t make it.  He got about halfway through the missionary journey and Mark quit and took off for home.   \n\nIn fact, Mark was partially responsible for breaking up the great duo of Paul and Barnabas.  When Paul and Barnabas were going on their second missionary journey, Barnabas wanted to bring Mark, but Paul said “No way. That guy took off on us last time.” They couldn’t agree about it, so they parted ways and found new ministry partners.\n\n**So Mark failed...the end, right?**  Well, no.  Mark later became a helper to the apostle Peter.  Peter called Mark “his son in the faith.”  In fact, a lot of people think that most of the book of Mark came from Peter, that Mark just recorded what Peter said, and that view makes a lot of sense.  \n\nLater on in Paul’s ministry, even Paul sent for Mark and said he was “profitable.”  And of course, Mark was given the honor of being the human penman a book of the Bible, one of the gospel records.\n\nSo before I go any further this morning, I want to say this:  **Just like Mark, You might have had a terrible failure in your life, but failures aren’t final. God isn’t through with you; He can use you again.**  Proverbs says, *“A just man falleth seven times, and riseth again,”* and Jeremiah taught us that God’s mercies are *”new every morning.”*\n\nOur God is a God of second chances and third chances and fourth and fifth chances.  \n\nHe’s the God who made a special trip after His crucifixion to see Peter.  Remember: Peter had given up.  Peter had publicly denied Jesus three times while Jesus was on the cross.  Peter had gone back to fishing.  But Jesus went after Peter and said, *”Feed my sheep.”*\n\nYou may have fallen and you may have failed, but God isn’t through with you yet.  There are still things you can do for God.  Let Mark’s name at the top of this book be a reminder that **God uses failures.  Failure isn’t final.**\n\nSo we’ve seen the unique nature of this book: It’s a short book full of Jesus’ actions.  We’ve seen the human penman of this book: Mark.  Let’s look at the third thing I want you to understand before we get into Mark...\n\n## 3. I want us to understand the **Divine Subject** of the book of Mark.\nLook at verse 1 again:\n\n> *”The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the son of God.”*\n\nThis book is all about the **greatest subject ever written about: Jesus Christ the Son of God.**\n\nI love biographies.  I read biographies all the time.  There are some people whom I so admire I’ve read several biographies about them.  They are great subjects.  **No one was ever a greater subject than Jesus Christ.**\n\nAnd **I want you to understand that Jesus’ name is special**.  Look at the three parts of His name here in verse 1:\n\n**Jesus** \n\nIn Matthew 1:21 the angel came to Joseph and said, *“You shall call his name Jesus: for He shall save his people from their sins.”*. **Jesus is a name that means “Jehovah is salvation.”**  It’s the New Testament version of the Old Testament name “Joshua.”  \n\n“Jesus” reminds us that He is our **Savior**.  He didn’t just come to act and to serve and to do miracles.  He didn’t just come to teach.  He came to save.  He came to die on the cross for our sins.\n\nThe second part of his name is: \n\n**Christ**\n\nA lot of folks think “Christ” is Jesus’ last name, like “Hayden” or “Roberts.”  That’s not so.  **“Christ” is actually a title.**  Many times in scripture Jesus is called “the Christ.”\n\n**“Christ” actually means “messiah” or “anointed one.”**  When we call Jesus “the Christ” we are acknowledging that He is the one that all the Old Testament scriptures were pointing to.  He is the one that is the fulfillment of all of the Old Testament.  \n\nThe Jews didn’t understand this, but all of those Old Testament stories, rites and prophecies were just foreshadowing Jesus the Christ.  \n\n* In the story of Abraham, He was the lamb caught in the thickets that became a replacement for Isaac.\n* In Exodus, He is the Passover lamb whose blood covered the households and kept away the angel of death.  \n* In the wilderness, He was the serpent on the pole that people could look to and be saved.\n* In the tabernacle, He is the blood sprinkled on the Holy of Holies on the day of Atonement.\n* In Ruth, He was the kinsman redeemer.\n* In Song of Solomon, He was the chief among ten thousand and altogether lovely.\n* In Isaiah, He is the one who Isaiah wrote about when he said, *”Surely He hath born our griefs and carried our sorrows.”*\n* In Haggai, He is the one that Haggai called *”The desire of nations”*\n\nAnd we could go on and on and on.\n\nHe is the Christ.  He is the Messiah.  He is the fulfillment of all of the Old Testament promises.  \n\nBut Mark doesn’t just call Him Jesus and Christ.  Mark calls Him:\n\n**The Son of God**\n\n He isn’t just a Savior.  He isn’t just the anointed one.  **He is Divine.**  He is *Emmanuel*, God with us (Matthew 1:23).  He is the only begotten son of God.\n\nMany people will read the gospel records and the life of Jesus, and they’ll say, “He was a great man and a great teacher.”  No.  No, He was much, much more than that; **He was the Son of God.  He is a member of the Trinity.  He is coequal and coexistent with God the Father.** \n\nNobody could do the things we’ll read about in Mark but God.  Nobody could command the storms, walk on water, raise the dead, and heal the blind.  He’s God, folks.\n\nAnd do you know what that means? That means **when we read the acts of Jesus here in the book of Mark, we are seeing a living example of the character of God.**  You’ve all known someone who was “all talk.”  You’ve all known someone whose “bark was worse than his bite.”  \n\nHere in the book of Mark **we get to see that Jesus’ walk matched His talk**, and we get to understand that His actions represent the Heart of God on display for us!  \n\n* When we see Jesus healing, we know God is a healing God.  \n* When we see Jesus raise the dead, we understand our God has power over death and life.  \n* When we see Him calm the storms, we know that God has power over the storms of life.  \n* When we see Him care - we know our God cares.\n\nSo, I’ve talked about the nature of this book, about the human penman, about the divine subject.  There is just one more thing I want us to understand this morning and it is...\n\n## 4. I want us to understand the **important purpose** of the book of Mark.\n\nLook at verse 1, one more time:\n\n> *”The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.”*\n\nMany people believe that this book was written in Rome, right after the book of Romans.  The timeline goes like this:  Mark is in Rome, and he gets to read the book of Romans and He thinks, “That’s good; that’s really good.  Maybe these Roman people need to hear the backstory of this.”\n\nSo Mark sets out, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to write the story of Jesus’ life.  *“The beginning of the gospel.”*. And like all of the gospel records, it’s going somewhere.  It’s headed to the cross.\n\nThe word “gospel” means “good news.”  The “good news” here isn’t Jesus’ life. It’s Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection.  Mark is just preparing us to hear that.\n\nThe good news is that Jesus died on the cross for your sins, He came to be your substitute.  The good news is you just have to believe on Him, and you can be saved.\n\nHave you trusted Christ as your savior? Have you believed the gospel?  Has Christ been your substitute?  It would be a shame to know all about Jesus as we study of the book of Mark, but not to know Him as your savior.\n\nI want to give you the opportunity to trust Christ this morning.  Let’s all stand together with every head bowed and every eye closed.\n\n  \n\n",

    "body": "Have you ever needed to be reminded of something you already knew? We live in the information age, which means there’s more stuff at your disposal than ever before. It can lead to an information overload, where it feels like your brain has hit max capacity and sometimes things just slip out. This happens to my mom sometimes, where she has something seemingly on the tip of her tongue and she can’t quite remember what it is. It’s particularly bad with names, where she’ll be trying to tell me about someone but she can’t quite recall their name. This may be bad, but sometimes I’ll act like I don’t know who she’s talking about just to see how long it takes before she finally remembers their name. \n\nWe also live in a world where people are busier than they’ve ever been before. It’s not necessarily that we are accomplishing more than we ever have before, but there is certainly no lack of things to do, whether it’s for business or for pleasure. We have been inundated by stuff, more stuff than we know what to do with. \n\nThere’s no denying that we live in a world where people are far more interconnected and networked than they’ve ever been before. Before modern technology and transportation came around, the circle of friends of an average person was extremely limited. Most people never ventured outside of a 25-mile radius from where they were born. That’s almost unfathomable to think of today. Through social media and cell phones, I can communicate with people all over the world in a flash. \n\nThis abundance of stuff can also bring with it a large portion of worry and anxiety. I think it’s fair to say that people today have more things that they worry about than they ever have before. At times, the sheer amount of stuff we face can get a bit overwhelming. It can be too much for us to bear. However, no matter how big the world may seem to be getting or how heavy our burdens may be, there’s one thing that’s still as true today as it was back when it was written here. Intuitively, we may know this fact, but sometimes we need to be reminded of it because we’re not applying it and living it the way we should be. Sometimes we just need someone to ask us: “Is anything too hard for the Lord?” Of course, we know the answer to this question, but sometimes we live like we don’t know it. Sometimes we just need a helpful reminder, and that is what God gives, not just to Abraham and Sarah, but to us as well in this chapter.\n\n[Read Genesis 18:1-15, pray, and then explain the story up to this point]\n\n1. The Hospitality of Abraham (18:1-8) – It is interesting to see how Abraham reacts to the presence of these guests. Two of them were angels, and one of them was the Lord. We don’t know how long it took before Abraham realized who they were, but he did not waste any time making them feel at home. He runs to meet them. He gets them some water to wash their feet and he gives them a place to sit down and relax. He prepares a meal for his guests, and as they eat, he stands by them almost like a waiter ready to get anything they need.\n\nAbraham takes all the responsibility for providing for these guests upon himself. He did not have to do that. He had plenty of servants he could have made do all the work. He had some of them help him, of course, but he does his part as well. I think the important lesson we can take from this is that Abraham never got too big to be a servant. After all the amazing promises that God made to him in the last chapter, Abraham could have let that go to his head. He could have said, “I am now the father of many nations, and my wife is now a princess. I’ve done my part, and I’ve paid my dues. We’re too good for all this servant business. That’s below me.” He never let himself get complacent like that. \n\nJesus Christ had the same attitude. Mark 10:45 says, “For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.” Jesus did not come to have people serve Him—although many did—but He came to serve others. The world today tries to teach us that the way to be great is to climb the corporate ladder and get to the top so you can boss everyone down below you. Many people are more interested in getting to a place where they can have people serve them so they don’t have to serve anyone else anymore. That should not be our attitude. That’s the way the world works. God made it clear that the way up is down. “Whoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.” \n\nIf there’s something that needs to be done around the church, do what you can to help. It may be a menial task like moving tables and chairs, but we should always desire to serve others, even in the smallest capacity. Maybe it’d be better to say “especially in the smallest capacity.” All throughout the New Testament, you can see Jesus and the apostles praise those who may have done or given something that seemed small in man’s eyes, but it is great in the sight of God. Jesus urged His disciples to be faithful in the little things, because you won’t be faithful in the big things if you’re not faithful in the little things first. Nothing should be considered too little for us.\n\nWe should also note how hard Abraham worked for his guests. If you look at the text, you can see him hurrying from place to place, getting everything set up, and working hard to provide the best meal that he could for his guests. I think this speaks of the importance of doing our best in whatever God has given us to do. Colossians 3:22-24 says, “Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto me; Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.” Christians should be the hardest working people at their jobs because we have a greater motivation to be a good worker than the world does. They’re doing it for themselves or for the money. We’re doing it for the Lord and for an eternal reward. We should work at our jobs as if we’re doing it directly for God Himself. That’s what those verses are saying. Your work ethic is a testimony about the God you serve. \n\n2. The Doubt of Sarah (18:9-12) – After the meal, the Lord turns His attention to Sarah. This would have only been a very short time after the promise He made to Abraham in chapter 17, but He reiterates the promise that he and Sarah will have a son within the next year. I think He asked where Sarah was to make sure she heard it this time, too. Her reaction to the statement is similar to Abraham’s, but the attitude behind it was different. Sarah laughed when she heard the Lord promise that she would have a son. While Abraham’s laughter was one of joy, Sarah’s laughter was one of doubt. We can tell that by God’s reactions to each. Abraham was not rebuked for his laughter the way Sarah is here. \n\nIt is interesting to note that Sarah did not laugh out loud or speak out loud. The Bible says she laughed within herself. However, the Lord knows our thoughts, so even then, we cannot hide anything from Him. Sometimes we are not so different from Sarah. We can hear a message from the Bible or we can read something in it, and while we may not openly scoff at it—We wouldn’t dare do that—we scoff at it in our hearts. We can hear something like Romans 8:28, “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose,” and react with, “It sure doesn’t feel like it to me.” \n\nWe can hear a great promise on prayer like Matthew 7:7, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you,” and we doubt it. How do I know we doubt it? Because we don’t do it. If we really believed that promise was true, we’d practice it. Our prayer lives would be so much more fervent than they are. I say “we” because I’m including myself in this. We all struggle with doubt. We might think, “It worked back in those days, but it doesn’t really feel like it’s working for me.” That’s why we need a reminder about this next thing:\n\n3. The Power of the Lord (18:13-15) – In response to Sarah’s laughter, the Lord asks her a very pointed question: “Is anything too hard for the Lord?” The Hebrew phrase translated “too hard” there can mean “beyond,” “surpassing,” or “unimaginable.” In other words, He is asking, “Is anything beyond my ability? Is there something that surpasses the Lord’s power? Is there something that seems unimaginable, even to God?” \n\nThe Bible makes it very clear that the answer to that question is “No.” Those things may be beyond us. They may be bigger than we can handle. They may seem unimaginable to us, but as Jesus said in Luke 19:27, “The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.” Luke 1:37 adds, “For with God nothing shall be impossible.”\n\nEphesians 3:20 makes it very clear that nothing can surpass God’s ability. “Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.” The Lord can do things that are simply unimaginable to us. It may seem impossible to you, but all things are possible to Him. Also, did you catch that last part? “According to the power that worketh in us.” That same power that makes the impossible possible is working in you. God wants to do impossible things in your life. Many times, the only reason He doesn’t is because we won’t trust Him with them. \n\nThis idea of having a baby when she and Abraham were old seemed impossible for Sarah. However, once she got this much-needed reminder that nothing is too hard for God, she bought in. Hebrews 11:11 tells us, “Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.” We don’t see it explicitly in the text in Genesis 18, but once the Lord hit her with that question, she knew the right answer and she responded in faith. She determined that He is the God of the impossible, and she believed He would give her a child. Sometimes we just need someone to rebuke us straight to our face to get our attention and get us to do what we should have been doing all along. \n\n4. The Plea of Abraham (18:16-33) – The second half of this chapter is primarily devoted to Abraham’s intercession with the Lord over Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham is sometimes referred to in Scripture as the Friend of God, and this section demonstrates why he earned that title. The Lord did not have to reveal His plans to Abraham, but He chose to. Why? Look at verse 19. God knew Him. He knew certain things about Abraham were true, and He knew He could trust him with His will. The Lord knew Abraham so well that He knew what he would do before he had even done it yet. The same is true for you. What does God know about you? He knows everything about you, but if He were to say, “For I know [insert name here], that he/she will…” How would He finish that sentence? \n\nI think there are some characteristics from Abraham’s prayer we can learn to apply in our own prayer lives as well:\n\nA. He was compassionate – It's interesting to observe that Abraham does not just intercede for Lot, although I’m sure that was one of the factors that prompted this conversation. He could have just asked God to get Lot and his family out of there, but he did not do that. He pleaded for the Lord to spare the city for the sake of a certain number of righteous people who may be dwelling in that city. Abraham was well aware of how wicked Sodom and Gomorrah were, and he was not asking the Lord to spare the wicked because he really had no right to do that. He was asking God to spare the city for the sake of those living in it who were righteous. That would mean the wicked would be spared as a result, so Abraham was showing concern for all people in the city. He had no desire to see God’s judgment fall on all those people, even though He would be totally just in doing so. \n\nWe can also observe that the Lord was more than willing to stay His judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah if He could find ample evidence to do so. God sent the two angels to investigate the situation there and determine if it was worthy of judgment. Of course, the Lord already knew the answer, but His holy justice, as well as His goodness to man, moved Him to demonstrate that He was in possession of the facts and was just in whatever He chose to do. It is also important to realize that God does not want to judge the wicked. It does not make Him happy. He does it because He is just and He must, but Ezekiel 33:11 says, “As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?”\n\nIn like manner, we should have compassion on this lost world as it is ravaged and ruined by sin. It is easy to look at the wicked and get angry at the way they live, and I believe there is a place for righteous anger. However, we should not desire for anyone to die and go to hell, but do we really want all people everywhere to be saved? Do we want the homosexuals, the atheists, the drug addicts, the alcoholics, the thieves, the liars, the criminals to be saved? Do we truly desire that? If we do, then we need to be faithful to pray for them and to go to them when we get the opportunity.\n\nB. He was specific – He did not communicate in generalities. He specifically gave God a number and pleaded it all the way down to the specific number of ten. Sometimes our prayer lives feel weak because we pray too generally. We may ask God to bless the missionaries, but how would we even know how He answered that prayer? This is part of the reason we read these prayer letters on Wednesday night, so that you can pray intelligently and specifically for these missionaries. I think when we fail to be specific, it’s because of a lack of faith because some part of us is afraid that the Lord either won’t do it or can’t do it. Let’s not be afraid to ask for specific things. Ask for specific people to be saved. Ask for specific needs in your life and the lives of others to be met in specific ways. Don’t be afraid to have a detailed conversation with God. Abraham wasn’t. Do you think that bothered God? I don’t get a sense of impatience or frustration from the Lord here.\n\nC. He was persistent – Abraham kept asking and kept asking God for more and more. He already knew that nothing was too hard for God, so that must also mean that nothing is too much to ask. Have you ever been afraid to talk to somebody or ask someone for a favor because you feel like you’ll be bothering them if you do? I think sometimes we treat the Lord like that, like we don’t want to bother Him or something. However, He delights in hearing from you. He wants you to speak to Him. He wants you to ask for things.\n\nJohn 16:24 says, “Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.” Jesus is inviting us to ask Him for things. Don’t be afraid to ask. I quoted Matthew 7:7 earlier, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” In the Greek, the idea is, “Ask and keep on asking; seek and keep on seeking; knock and keep on knocking.” Be persistent. Don’t give up so easily. Remember that God is often working in ways that we cannot see.\n\nD. He remembered the nature of God – Abraham knew he could ask for what he was asking for because he knew who God is. In verse 25, he asks the question, “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” I said before that sometimes we need people to remind us of stuff, but God never needs to be reminded of anything. This is merely Abraham acting on the basis of knowing that the Lord is the Judge of all the earth, and He will do right. \n\nWe can ask for certain things from God because we know who He is. We come to Him in prayer because we know He is loving, good, and just. It’s a good thing to bring up things you know about God in your prayer. It will reinforce your faith. It is good to bring up promises you’ve read in the Bible and claim them as you pray. God does not need to be reminded, but we do. \n\nI know this message has probably seemed all over the place and rather haphazard. We’ve covered a pretty broad range of topics tonight, but this is what the Lord laid on my heart to convey to you all tonight. I hope something that was said tonight was a help to you in some way.",

    "body": "# Fake Faith vs. Real Faith (James 2:14-26)\n\nI want you to take your Bibles with me and turn to the book of James, chapter 2.  We are going to cover a big section of scripture tonight, and we are really going to start moving through this book.\n\nThe topic of the message tonight is “fake faith.”  \n\nThe town we we lived in in Tennessee, Athens, is a little smaller than Mattoon.  The county down there is smaller than Coles County by a lot.  Yet when we were there, there were 86 Baptist churches in our county.  86!\n\nHere is the crazy thing: There were also huge groups of Pentecostal and Methodist churches in the area.  We had a Methodist college in town, and the headquarters for one branch of the Church of God was right down the road, so I mean there were churches everywhere!  Sometimes it seemed like there were more churches than people!\n\nAnd that meant that it was almost impossible to find people in the area who didn’t have a church background.  Almost everyone had a baptism story, was related to some pastor, or was a deacon at some church at some time.  \n\nBut here is the thing that really bothered me: So much of it was obviously fake.  You would think in such a Christian town that drugs wouldn’t be a problem; you’d think there would be no bars; you would think that teen pregnancy rates would be very low; you would think that the golf courses would be empty on Sunday, but you would think wrong.\n\nAlmost everyone could give a “profession of faith,” but so much of it seemed fake.\n\nThat’s what this second half of the chapter is about.  It’s about fake faith—useless, unfinished, dead faith; faith that is all talk and no substance; faith that makes no difference in your own life and in the life of the community.\n\nBefore I get into the text, I want to make three very important points about this passage because it’s easy to get confused in this passage:\n\n#### 1. This passage is talking about the nature of faith, not about the way of salvation.\n\nThis passage almost seems to contradict what other books, like Galatians and Romans, say about salvation.  It seems to be saying that you are saved by works.  \n\nBut that isn’t what it is saying at all.  It’s not really talking about salvation.  We are saved by grace through faith.  Our salvation is God’s work, not ours.  \n\nWhat it’s talking about—and only what it is talking about—is the nature of faith.  What faith is real and what faith is fake.\n\nIt’s really, really important that you understand that this ISN’T A SALVATION PASSAGE.  \n\nA second thing that is important to remember is...\n\n#### 2. There is a difference between what James calls deeds of faith and what Paul calls works of the law.\n\nThe Bible is very, very, clear that you aren’t saved by the works of the law.  There are literally two whole books in the New Testament that make that point (Romans and Galatians), as well as lots of scripture in other books in the New Testament.  Even the book of James makes that point (that’s what we talked about last week).\n\nBut as you are going to see, this passage talks about “being justified by works.”  That’s confusing.\n\nRemember: This is talking about proving that your faith is real, not about being saved.  This is talking about being justified to others as much as it is talking about being justified to God.  It’s about showing to others that your faith isn’t fake faith.\n\nSo there is a difference between works of faith and works of the law.  Works of faith are things we do because we believe the Gospel and because God has changed our life.  They are NOT things we do in order to get saved and to earn God’s favor.\n\nWorks of the law, on the other hand, are things we do to try to earn God’s favor in Salvation.  \n\nSo works of faith are for after salvation, while works of the law are works to earn salvation.  \n\nOne more thing...\n\n#### 3. This passage isn’t promoting salvation *by* works, but salvation *that* works.\n\nThat’s really the important distinction here.  What this is saying is that talk is cheap.  Anyone can say they are saved.  Anyone can say they have believed the gospel.  Anyone can say they have faith.\n\nAnd there are no works required for salvation.  It’s all about God’s work.  It’s all about what Jesus did on the cross.\n\n> *”For by grace are ye saved through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast”* (Ephesians 2:8-9)\n\nSo let’s be clear.  Let me say this for the fifteenth time already, and I haven’t even read the text yet:  You are not saved by works. There are no works required for salvation.\n\nBut there is another thing we also have to recognize, and that is when a person does get saved—again, not by works—God changes them.  *Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.* The Holy Spirit moves in.  They are born again.  They are regenerated.  \n\nAnd if you are regenerated (born again), then you are going to have some fruit show up in your life.  \n\nSo we don’t believe in salvation *by* works, but the Bible (and this passage) clearly teaches salvation *that* works.\n\nThat’s enough introductory stuff.  That’s enough about what this text ISN’T saying.  Let’s read the text and talk about what it IS saying.\n\nJames 2:14-26:\n\n> *”14 What [doth it] profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? 15 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, 16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be [ye] warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what [doth it] profit? 17 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.”*\n\n> *”18 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. 19 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble. 20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 22 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect? 23 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God. 24 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.”*\n\n> *”Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent [them] out another way?”*\n\n> *”For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”*\n\n\n***Let’s pray and ask God’s blessing on the sermon tonight.***\n\nI believe what this passage is about is how to spot fake faith; how to spot religious posers; how to spot those who are only talking but who are not walking.\n\nThat’s fake faith.  I think James contrasts fake faith with real faith here and lets us know about three differences.\n\nSo three points tonight and all of them are a contrast between fake faith and real faith:\n  \nThe first difference is...\n\n## 1. Fake faith is useless, but real faith makes a difference.\n\nNotice the question at the beginning of verse 14 and the end of verse 16:\n\n> *”What doth it profit?”*\n\n\nIn other words: What’s the point?  What’s the use?  \n\nIn this section, it talks about someone who says to a poor person in the church—someone who cannot even eat because he’s starving—*be warmed and fillled* and *depart in peace,* but you don’t DO anything to help that person, what’s the point?  What’s the use?  It’s just talk. It makes no difference whatsoever.\n\nThat’s the first difference between fake faith and real faith. Fake faith is just vain words. Fake faith is just posturing. Real faith makes a difference.  Real faith makes a dent.\n\nThere is a furniture store we really like to go to in St. Louis called IKEA.  They are these huge stores with a restaurant and giant displays you can walk through, and my favorite section is always the desk and office section.  \n\nSo I’ll be walking through the desk and office section at IKEA, and I’ll be sitting in all these cool chairs at all these cool fancy display desks. Then my hands will move to the computer on the desk, and it’s nothing.  It’s literally a cardboard cutout of a computer.  How useless!\n\nFake faith is like a costume weapon. It might look convincing at a glance, but it doesn’t *do* anything and makes no difference.  \n\nFake faith is like a hologram.  It looks convincing, but it can’t move anything.  \n\nReal faith, by contrast, does make a difference.  It makes a difference in your life, and it makes a difference in the lives of people you meet.  Real faith might not be flashy, but it’s real.  It’s not all talk; it’s action.\n\nFake faith will say, “I’m a Christian.”  Real faith will actually go to church.  Fake faith will say, “I want to serve God and help people.”  Real faith will actually teach a Sunday school lesson or help in Vacation Bible School.\n\n\nTalk is cheap.  Look at verses 19-20.  Anyone can say they believe the basic doctrines of the Bible.  Even the demons believe the basic doctrines of the Bible, but how are those doctrines making a difference in you and through you?  \n\nReal faith makes a difference.  \n\n---\n\nA second thing we see in this passage about the difference between real faith and fake faith is...\n \n## 2. Fake faith is unfinished, but real faith follows through.\n\nIn verses 21-24, it talks about Abraham and Isaac—that famous story where God told Abraham to offer his son, his only son Isaac.  It stands as one of the most amazing acts of faith in the whole Bible.\n\nAnd notice what verse 22 says:\n\n> *”Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.”*\n\nThe word “perfect” in the Bible rarely means “perfect” as we use it today.  Most of the time, it means “complete,” “finished,” or “mature.”\n\nAnybody can say they believe anything.  It’s the easiest thing in the world to profess faith in some thing, but faith is unfinished until it is acted on.\n\nRead the great “Hall of Faith” passage in Hebrews 11 sometime.  Not one of those people are commended because they believed the right things.  They did believe the right things, but it wasn’t until their faith turned into faith-driven action did they become commendable.\n\nThink about it this way:  I could say something like, “The building is on fire!”  And you could say, “Amen, preacher!  Yes, we believe it!  The building is on fire!”  But if you stay in your seats, do you really believe it?  Is your faith in that statement real?  If you really believed it, you would live it.  You would rush downstairs and get the kids out of the nursery, and you would rush outside and call 911.  \n\nFaith, when it is real, doesn’t get aborted before it’s complete.  It follows through with action.\n\nJames has already told us *”Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves”* (1:22).\n\nYou can say you believe, but if it doesn’t actually affect your life—if it doesn’t actually turn into action at some point—isn’t that kind of self-deception?  \n\nFake faith is useless, fake faith is unfinished, and one more thing...\n\n## 3. Fake faith is unanimated (dead), but real faith is alive.\n\nTwice in this passage it talks about dead faith.  Verse 17 says:\n\n\n> *”Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.”*\n\nAnd verse 26 says:\n\n> *”For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.”*\n\nAll of us, no doubt, have been to funerals, and we’ve had to look at someone we knew in a casket.  It’s a weird and morbid thing because we know they aren’t really there.  It’s just their shell.  It’s just their body.  Their soul and their spirit are elsewhere.\n\nThat’s the picture here.  Someone whose faith is all talk and no action has unanimated faith.  The shell might be there, but there is no life in it.\n\n### Tying it all together\n\nThe point of all of these pictures is the same: Real faith is going to act.  Real faith isn’t just talk. It follows through to action.  There is life in it.  It is visible.  It makes a difference.\n\nJames is teaching us in this book that if we really believe that we’ve been saved by grace by the free gift of God, we really ought to be giving to others. \n\nIf we really believe that we’ve been saved by grace, our language is going to be different.  We are going to let God control our hearts, and that’s going to show in our tongues.\n\nIf we really have faith in what the Bible teaches, it’s going to change our relationship to this wicked world.  \n\nThere are going to be visible displays of our faith.\n\nNow listen, I don’t think this passage was intended for us to use as a measuring stick for other people.  This is not for judging the fakeness of other people’s faith. I think this was intended for measuring our own faith.\n\nAnd it’s a good passage for that. It’s a good passage for showing us when our own faith is kind of fake.  But what is the solution?  Is it to try harder?  Is it to put more effort into it?\n\nI don’t think so.  I don’t think that helps at all. \n\nTurn back a few pages to Hebrews 12.  This is a continuation of the passage I mentioned earlier.  The great “Hall of Faith” passage tells us about how faith moved Abraham, Moses, and so many others to do great things for God.\n\nAnd you would think that Hebrews 11 would end with a command such as, “Go and do likewise,” or “You go and be great like Moses and Abraham,” but it doesn’t.  Look at how this passage ends in Hebrews 12:1.\n\n> *”Wherefore seeing we also are compasses about with so great a cloud of witnesses”*\n\nSo it’s using a racing metaphor here.  We are in a race—a marathon—and these people in Hebrews 11 are cheering us on. They’ve already run their race.  They are cheering us on in our faith.\n\nLet’s keep reading:\n\n> *”Let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.”* \n\nSo we have to run our race.  We have our own faith race to run, and we can’t be beset with sin and weights.  We aren’t going to make it through this marathon if we are carrying a backpack full of rocks.\n\nBut I want you to notice the next phrase:\n\n> *”Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith: who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.”*\n\nDo you know how we make our faith real?  How we make it alive?  We keep looking to Jesus.\n\n```\n \nTurn your eyes upon Jesus\nLook full in His wonderful face\nAnd the things of earth will grow strangely dim\nIn the light of His glory and grace\n```",

    "body": "# Jesus and His Family (Mark 3:31-35)\nOver the last year and a half or so, I’ve spent a lot of time on the phone with a man halfway across the world in India.  His name is Chirag.  Chirag was helping me do some computer stuff, and that necessitated being on the phone with him for about an hour several times a week.  We became friends.\n\nOne of the things that I learned quickly is that life in India is nothing like life in America.  \n\nNo matter what time it was over there, there was lots and lots of background noise.  There were always horns honking and the distant sound of music.  Always.\n\nAnother thing I realized pretty quickly is that people over there don’t tend to have the same waking and sleeping schedule that we have.  They tend to sleep in late into the morning and stay up pretty late at night.\n\nThere are a bunch of other differences, too. They are super into cricket.  Most people drive motorcycles and not cars.  They eat only vegetables, and they drink tea, not coffee.  Most Indians never venture very far from their home. Chirag lives in a little city called Rajkot, and even though he’s college-educated, he’s never been more than about a hundred miles away.\n\nBut the biggest difference I found out about Indians through my relationship with Chirag is how they think about family.  In India, family seems to be everything.  We think of ourselves as individuals; they think of themselves as part of a group.  It’s their primary identification.\n\nChirag lives in a house with his parents, his brothers, sisters, and their kids.  When he gets married (which is going to happen soon), his parents will have selected his wife, and most likely, his family will continue to live with them.  \n\nWhat we have in the United States and in other western countries is kind of unique.  We are a highly, highly individualistic society.  But most of the world—especially the Eastern world—is far, far more family-oriented than we are.\n\nI tell you that because our text today tells a little story about Jesus and His family that seems a little harsh to us, but to the people in Jesus’ day and even to people today in eastern cultures, it was beyond harsh.  It must have seemed like a nuclear bomb.  It must have seemed like a man slapping everything sacred about culture in the face.\n\nBefore we read our text, I want to remind you of what we learned last week.  In verse 21, we learn that Jesus’ people (our verse says “His friends,” but it’s better read as “His family and people from His hometown”) wanted to lay hold on Him because they thought He was beside Himself.  In other words, they thought Jesus had gone crazy and wanted to abduct Him for His own good.  They wanted to stage an intervention.\n\nMost commentators and Bible scholars see verses 31-35 as a continuation of that, so let’s read these verses and remember that they are weighted a bit.  Mary and Jesus’ brothers aren’t outside just wanting to chat; they are outside wanting to force Jesus to come home.\n\nLet’s read the text:\n\n> *”31 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him. 32 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee. 33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren? 34 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! 35 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”*\n\nI’m going to break this message into two parts.  First, we’ll talk briefly about what was going on in this story.  Second, we’ll talk about what Jesus was trying to teach us in this story.  \n\nLet’s pray and then we’ll jump right into that.\n\n## 1. What happened in this story\n\nSo picture this: Jesus is teaching this vast crowd of people.  He’s healing people.  He’s casting out demons.  Then along comes His family.  Maybe they came from the next town over on foot.  It’s His mom, His brothers, and maybe some close family friends.  They’ve come for an intervention.  \n\nThey are dead serious about it.  This son, brother, and friend that they love has gone too far, they say.  He’s lost His mind.  He’s acting like a crazy person, and He’s going to hurt Himself.  It’s time to make Him come home and straighten Him out a bit.\n\nI imagine they get to the edge of the crowd, and instead of being in awe of it, they are disgusted.  The Bible says they stood without.  They wouldn’t go in.  They wouldn’t participate.  They wanted nothing to do with Jesus and what He was doing.\n\nMaybe Mary goes up to one of Jesus’ disciples and says in her sternest voice, “Tell my son His mom wants to see Him.”\n\nI know this isn’t the Mary you grew up imagining, but that Mary is mostly myth.  I believe that Mary was a special woman and a godly woman.  I believe that she became a follower of Christ later on, but she wasn’t at this point the saint we imagine when we talk about Mary.  She certainly wasn’t the “perpetual virgin” as it’s taught.  She is there with her other sons.  We know at least two of their names. James and Jude would go on to be leaders in the early church and would both write books of the Bible, but at this point, none of them are into what Jesus is doing. They are standing outside in protest.  \n\nImagine with me the whispers in the crowd.  They start to see what is going on.  This is embarrassing, especially in Jesus’ culture.  His family is against what He is doing.\n\nFinally, one of the disciples speaks up and says, “Your mother and brethren are without, and, um, they want to speak with you.”  I think whoever said that knew they wanted to do more than speak with Jesus.   Jesus certainly knew.  \n\nWhat was He going to do?  Imagine the hush that fell on the crowd.  People straining their eyes in anticipation. \n\nAnd Jesus does something absolutely startling.  He doesn’t  stop what He’s doing.  He barely acknowledges His mother and His brethren.  He looks at His disciples and at the faithful crowd and He asks a question:\n\n> *“Who is my mother, or my brethren?”*\n‭\nThen He makes a sweeping gesture with His hands at all of the disciples in the room and says: \n\n> *”Behold my mother and brethren.”*\n\nAnd adds: \n\n> *”For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”*\n\nCan you imagine the shock of this eastern crowd?  I don’t think they had any idea what to say or think about this.  Imagine the disappointment that Mary and her other sons felt.  They were probably doing this in love.  It was misguided, but I don’t think they had anything in mind other than the health and well-being of their brother.  Yet they are rebuffed and ignored, and publicly, at that.\n\nJesus didn’t do this on accident.  He was trying to teach us something.  So let’s look at the second part of our message:\n\n## 2. What this story teaches us:\n\nThere are three things I think Jesus was teaching us in this story.  The first thing is...\n\n### A. About our relationship with Jesus.\n\nJesus said that if we do His will, we are His family.  If we are serving God, we can expect a closeness and a care that you would expect from a loving family member. \n\nListen: If you are a saved person, then you are a member of God’s family.  You’ve been “born again,” and God is your Heavenly Father, but you might not always feel that way.  Sometimes God feels distant.  Sometimes God feels far away.  \n\nI think what Jesus was saying is that it is when we are obeying God’s will—when we are walking with Him and doing what He asks of us—then we feel this family closeness to God.\n\nI’ll put it this way: Let’s imagine one of our kids comes home from camp and you ask them, “How was summer camp last week?”  And they say, “It was boring.  So, so boring.  I got nothing out of it.”\n\n“Really?  Well, did you enjoy the swimming hole and the water slide?”\n\n“No, I didn’t want to do that.  It looked too scary.”\n\n“Okay, well, did you have fun during the games?  Did you play big ball basketball, human foosball and all those other exciting games?  How were those?”\n\n“No. They didn’t look like any fun.”\n\n“Well, what about the services?  What about the singing?\n\n“I wasn’t into it.  I was playing on my phone the whole time.”\n\nWe’d look at a kid like that and we’d say, “Of course you didn’t get anything out of camp.  You didn’t put anything into it.  You barely participated.  You were there and little else.”\n\nAnd a lot of people say, “I don’t feel close to God.  I’m not getting anything out of church.  The Bible doesn’t mean anything to me.”  And they are barely participating!  They might come to church once or twice a month.  They aren’t serving.  They aren’t reading their Bible.  They aren’t praying.   Of course it doesn’t mean as much to you!  You aren’t putting yourself into it barely at all!\n\nMy wife pointed me to an article in Fox News this week about American Christianity.  The writer said that 80% of Americans say they believe in God, but yet church attendance is falling off.  His point was that people view church as optional.  It’s like renters insurance.  They look at church as consumers.  It’s a very low priority.\n\nAnd if you look at church that way, then of course you aren’t going to get anything out of it.  When the local church has to compete with Hollywood, the internet, and the various clubs and sports you are a part of, of course you aren’t going to get much out of it.\n\nLast week, quite suddenly, we were going to youth camp with our kids.  It was great, but it meant that our kids had to miss a very important week of swim.  They had their conference meet on Saturday, and they were going to miss the whole week before the conference meet. There was no doubt it was going to hurt their times.\n\nSo we went to camp. Then we went to the meet, and neither of the girls had an awesome day.  Both of them were a bit slower than previous meets.  We were talking about it with them afterwards, and we all came to the same conclusion: Church comes first; God comes first.  If we have to do this every summer, so be it.  If they went from first to worst, it wouldn’t matter. We’d still go to camp over sports.\n\nListen: If you are trying to take this book and live it—if you are reading it, trying to act it out day by day, staking your reputation on what God’s Word says, and using it as your standard of practice in your family, in your workplace, and everywhere—I guarantee you that God will mean more to you.  \n\nListen, folks: Jesus is offering this deep family relationship with Himself.  He wants to be to you like a brother; in fact, closer than a brother, but like any relationship, you have to engage.  You have to talk to Him and listen to Him.\n\nThe second thing this passage teaches us is...\n\n### B. About our relationship with our spiritual family.\n\nYou see, not only does Jesus give us a relationship with Himself, He gives us a new spiritual family.  If we are His mother and His brethren, then that means the other people who are doing God’s will are also our spiritual family.\n\nOne thing that is super obvious as you read the New Testament is that these Christians meant a lot to each other.  They called each other brother and sister, as well as things like “my son in the faith.”\n\nListen to some of the “one another” verses from the New Testament:\n\n> *”Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;”* (Romans 12:10)\n\n> *”Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.”* (Romans 13:8)\n\n> *”Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.”* (Romans 15:7)\n\n> *”Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.”* (Romans 16:16)\n\n> *”For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another*.” (Galatians 5:13)\n\n> *”And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you.”* (Ephesians 4:32)\n\n> *”Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.”* (Colossians 3:13)\n\n> *”Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.”*. (Colossians 3:16)\n\nI could go on.  Hopefully, you get the point.  \n\nI’ve told you so many times, but this story reminds us of it.  Christianity was never intended to be this consumeristic, individualistic, designer, fast-food convenience thing.  It’s supposed to look at lot more like Chirag’s idea of family than our individualistic culture.  \n\nIn fact, a huge part of the New Testament is absolutely impossible to obey outside of a local church fellowship.\n\nI thank God for my spiritual family.  Some of you are a little bit nuts.  There are some crazy uncles in here, but we have those in our regular family, too.  We aren’t perfect; we are just brought together by the cross of Christ.  Just like our human families should stick together, we need to be there for our spiritual families.\n\nLet me brag on you folks for a minute and say I really believe our church is pretty good at this.  You care about each other.  You spend time with each other.  You pray for each other.  \n\nThat’s the way it ought to be.  There ought to be a spiritual bond in the truth that extends way beyond Sunday Morning service time.\n\nSo I’ve talked about what this passage teaches us about our family relationship with God, and I’ve talked about what it teaches us about our family relationship with each other. There is one more thing I want to talk about: What this teaches us…\n\n### C. About our relationship with our physical family.\n\nLet me tell you something: I love my family. I love my wife.  I love my kids.  Without a doubt the greatest blessings God has given me are family blessings.\n\nAnd you don’t see this, but I really love my extended family, too.  I have a bunch of brothers, and we are thick as thieves. I’ve got cute little nieces and nephews.  I talk to my parents almost every day.  I’ve got uncles and grandparents that are still alive that I’m pretty close to as well.  If you were to ask me what the hardest part about being a pastor is, it’s not even close: It’s being away from my family so much.  \n\nIt’s the same way for my wife: She’s super close to her parents.  \n\nWe are looking forward to being with both families in a couple weeks and celebrating a wedding with my brother in Tennessee.  It’s going to be awesome.\n\nFamily is one of the greatest blessings that God gives us, and it should be a God-given priority.  God instituted three institutions—the family, the church, and the government—and all of them are important.  \n\nBut one of the things that this story teaches us is that there are things that are more important than family.  Our walk with God and our obedience to Him should come above even our ties to our family.\n\nOne of my favorite commentary writers, Kent Hughes, said this: \n\n> Many Christians and non-Christians alike have made the family everything.  Every moment of every day, every involvement, every commitment, every engagement is measured and judged by the question: how will this benefit my family?\n> \n> The tragedy is this: Every earthly loyalty, if it is made central, becomes idolatry, and all idolatries eventually destroy their worshippers.\n\nWhat Hughes was saying was this: Family can be a god, and when family becomes a god, it actually destroys your family because family isn’t supposed to be at the center of our lives. Our relationship with Jesus is supposed to be at the center.\n\nWhen Christ is at the center, you’ll be a better husband, a better wife, a better son, a better daughter, a better brother, or a better sister.  But it has to be Christ first, and everything else second.\n\nSometimes that means, like Jesus did in this passage, disappointing the ones we are closest to.  That might mean sending your young people off to serve Jesus rather than trying to hoard them to yourself.  That might mean disappointing your parents or your other family members by making church and God a priority in a way they don’t understand.\n\nLet me close by saying one more thing here:  Despite appearances in this story, Jesus did not forsake His earthly family.  One of the very last things He did on the cross was make sure His mother was taken care of by one of His disciples.  \n\nMuch of the New Testament talks about being the right kind of husband; the right kind of dad; the right kind of mother; the right kind of wife; the right kind of kids.  Family is important.  Family is Christian.  It just can’t be paramount.  It can’t be all-important. \n\n## Conclusion:\n* Some of you can’t have a truly Christian family because you’ve never trusted Christ.  You need to trust Him.\n* Some of you need to make church and Christ a priority again.\n* Some of you need to reinvest in fellowship.  You need spend some more time with your spiritual brothers and sisters. Why not invite someone new to dinner today or next week?",

    "body": "# Jesus Cleanses the Leper (Mark 1:35-45)\nOur text this morning is going to be Mark 1:35-45.\n\nWhat is the worst possible thing that could happen to you?  Be creative. Maybe you could end up forced to spend the rest of your life in an American Girl Doll store eating only canned tuna.  Maybe you’d end up stranded on a desert island with *that guy* from work and only canned okra to eat. We could play this game all day.  It could get really dark and ugly.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I cannot imagine a worse fate than being a leper in Palestine in Jesus’ day.\n\nLeprosy is a terrible disease.  It actually lays dormant with zero symptoms for years.  When it shows up, it shows up in these bumps and sores all over your body.  The bumps turn white, burst, and stink.\n\nImagine someone with bumps and open sores all over their body, all over their face. A few times, I’ve met people with bumps all over their body, people who are horribly deformed and every time, my natural reaction is repulsion.  Imagine being someone who was so deformed that every time someone looked at you, despite their best efforts, they made a face.  Imagine the children in their innocence pointing and saying, “Look, Mommy.”  That would be horrible enough.\n\nBut it was much, much worse than that.  Leprosy actually *numbs* you.  It kills the nerve endings in your skin.  You can’t feel anymore.  When you see a picture of a leper with no fingers or no toes or with missing facial features, it’s not because the leprosy eats away at their hands and feet.  (That’s what I always thought). No, the leprosy just kills their feeling, and they do that to themselves.  \n\nThis would be awful and sad if it killed you—like most diseases do—in a couple of months to a year, but leprosy is unique in that it takes decades to do its work.  You live as a rotting, deformed, numb, and feelingless person for twenty or thirty years, slowly getting worse and worse.\n\nI can’t think of anything worse than being a leper in Jesus’ day, but I haven’t gotten to the worst part yet.  You see, lepers in Jesus’ day were almost completely alone.  They were ostracized from society.\n\nLeviticus 13-14 lays out the law for lepers.  They had to let their hair out.  They had to wear all black like they were going to a funeral, and they had to live outside of the camp.  Anytime they were around people they had to yell, “Unclean! Unclean!”  No one was allowed to touch them.\n\nThe Jews had a way of taking God’s laws and making them worse.  They liked to be stricter than God (which, by the way, always hurts people).  Sometimes we think we are being extra holy when we demand that people take God’s laws to the extreme, and we add a little bit to what the Bible actually says so we are sure not to break it.  It’s not helpful. It’s always hurtful when we do that, and it makes God look like a monster.\n\nThe Jews in Jesus’ day had taken the law of the leper, which was already hard enough for these poor people, and added a lot to it.  The Jews had rules that you had to be at least six feet away from a leper at all times.  The Jews said that if a leper even entered your house, it would be unclean.  The Jewish leaders taught that it was holy not even to buy fruit on a street where a leper had walked.  \n\nSo being a leper meant living a walking death sentence:  Disfigured, disgusting, stinking, numb, alone, and despised.\n\nIn our text this morning, Jesus heals a leper, but He does more than that. Jesus **touches** a leper. It’s a beautiful story.  Let’s read it in Mark 1:35-45.\n\n> *”Mark 1:35-45 (KJV) 35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed. 36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him. 37 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee. 38 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth. 39 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils. 40 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 41 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean. 42 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed. 43 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away; 44 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. 45 But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.”*\n\nThe main thing I want to focus on in this passage is the healing of the leper, but I don’t want to pass over verses 35-39.  Remember that Jesus had just spent a whole day in Capernaum healing and preaching.  He’s exhausted, so He gets up a great while before day, in the “wee morning hours,” and He goes to pray in solitude.\n\nI mentioned this last week, but even Jesus relied on the power of prayer and a quiet time alone with God to do the things He did.  If Jesus had to spend time with God in prayer, how much more do we?\n\nWell, the disciples come and find him, and they tell him that everyone is looking for Him in Capernaum. Jesus says something interesting in reply.  He says, \n\n> *”Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also, for therefore came I forth.”*\n\nJesus was saying to these disciples, “We have to move on. I have to preach to everyone.”  And so verse 39 is one of those verses that probably encapsulates many months of time.  It says that Jesus preached in the synagogues throughout all Galilee.\n\nJesus went and preached the gospel to every town He could, just as He had in Capernaum.\n\nBut then, right after that, Mark tells us this story of a leper.  It says,\n\n> *”And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying to him.”*\n\nNow stop right there.  What we have here is an extreme act of faith on the part of this leper.  He came to Jesus.\n\nLepers didn’t come to anyone.  Lepers ran away.  Lepers shrunk away in shame.  Remember that the Pharisees taught if a leper so much as stepped foot in your house, then you would be unclean and your house would be unclean.  They bragged about not even buying fruit from vendors on streets where lepers had walked.  Lepers stayed far away from everyone.\n\nBut this leper came to Jesus.  He came right up to Jesus and kneeled down before Him, and he said, *“If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.”* In other words, “If you want to, Jesus, I know you can heal and cleanse me from this leprosy.”\n\nThat was a huge act of faith on the part of this leper.  First of all, he had to believe that Jesus would be willing to cleanse a leper like him.  It hadn’t happened yet.  He’d healed others, but never a leper.  So this man had to believe that Jesus would want to heal him.\n\nAnd secondly, he had to believe that Jesus *could* heal a leper.  This leper was taking a big risk. He was laying himself out in front of Jesus in all of his dirty, grotesque, leprous being.\n\nIn the Bible, leprosy is a picture of sin.  Notice that this man didn’t say, “Jesus, if you will, you can *heal* me.”  He said, “If you will, you can *cleanse* me.”\n\n**Just like leprosy, sin corrupts us and makes us stink.  It deforms us and makes us ugly.  It numbs us to the point where we can’t feel the things we should. It defiles us and makes us unclean, separating us from God and everything that is holy.**\n\nSin is ugly.  It’s destructive.  It’s contagious.  It slowly eats away at us until what is left is a disgusting mess of rotting, stinking deformity.\n\nYou find the man on parole with tattoos covering his body, an ugly inability to speak a sentence without cursing, addicted to drugs, vile and merciless to women, and do you know what? At one time, that guy was an innocent child.  What happened?  Sin happened; the leprosy of sin.\n\nYou go into the ghetto and you find the vilest prostitute—dirty mouth, dirty life, drug-addicted—and at one point, she was as innocent and sweet as one of the girls who took the children’s offering this morning.  What happened?  Sin.  The leprosy of sin deformed her.\n\nThat’s the extreme case, but sin deforms your life, too, in the way you talk to your spouse and the way you yell at your kids.  Selfishness.  Lust.  Lies.  Sin is a powerful destructive force in your life, too.  It is a disease that is numbing you, destroying you, deforming you.\n\nSin is unclean.  God cannot tolerate unclean.  God is going to judge sin.  God is going to separate himself from sin forever.\n\nAnd most sinners, when they see Jesus or when they see Christians, they run away.  They yell, “Unclean! Unclean!”  They tell themselves that church is for the good folks—for the kind of people who coach soccer teams, live in neat subdivisions, and drive new minivans.  Church is for people who have no dirt, sin, or deformity in their life.  They run away, and they never come to Jesus.\n\nBut the leper in this story had it right. He came right up to Jesus and said, *“If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.”* He didn’t try to dress himself up.  He didn’t try to make himself look good.  He didn’t try to be a “clean leper.” He just fell at the feet of Jesus as he was and said, “I know you can cleanse me. I know you can heal me.”\n\nNotice with me what Jesus did.\n\n## 1. Jesus had compassion\nPeople did not naturally have compassion on lepers.  They were sad, but they were more disgusting than sad;  more scary than sad.  They were deformed, and they were dangerous.  Most people who saw lepers were moved with revulsion, not moved with compassion.\n\nBut Jesus had compassion.\n\nWhen we look around us and see people living deformed lives from sin, our natural reaction is to look away.  It’s revolting.  It’s disgusting, but Jesus sees lost sheep; Jesus sees souls for whom He died; Jesus sees prodigal sons.  Jesus has compassion.\n\nIf you are sin-sick this morning and you come to Jesus as a sinner—as a liar, as a thief, as an addict, as whatever you are—if you come to Him to be cleansed, He won’t send you away.  He won’t mock you.  He’ll have compassion.\n\nHe’s the great physician.  He’s the loving Shepherd.  He’ll show compassion on you.\n\nNotice the second thing Jesus did when this leprous man came to Him.\n\n## 2. Jesus touched him.\n\nNo good Jew would ever touch a leper.  To touch a leper meant that you too were unclean.  To touch a leper meant that you might catch what they had.\n\nThis man may not have felt a compassionate touch for decades!  But Jesus tenderly reached out His hand and touched Him.  He was untouchable!  But Jesus touched Him.\n\nJesus loves to touch the untouchables.  The woman at the well, with all her husbands and adultery, and her mess of a life, Jesus went out of His way to touch her life.\n\nThe Gadarean maniac—living in the cave, tearing himself apart like a madman—Jesus went out of his way to touch him, too.\n\nEight times in the book of Mark, it tells us that Jesus touched people.  Jesus didn’t have to touch anyone.  Jesus can just speak and heal people, but He reached out and touched sinners.\n\nThere is this old song we used to listen to on a girls home CD:\n\n```\n?\nHow can we reach a world we never touch?\nHow can we show them Christ, if we never show them love?\nJust to say we care, will never be enough?\nHow can we reach a world we never touch?\n?\n```\n\n\nJesus had compassion, Jesus touched him, and look at the third thing this passage says Jesus did:\n\n## 3. Jesus spoke to Him\nJesus looked down with compassion and said to the man, *”I will; be thou clean.”*\n\nJesus could have said, “Get out of here, you filthy leper! You disgust me.”  He could have said, “How dare you defile me with your presence,” but no.  He said *”I will”—”I want to”—“Be thou clean.”*\n\nListen, sinner: Jesus wants to cleanse you. He wants to heal you.  If you come to Him in faith as a sinner, He won’t chastise you. He won’t send you away.  He will heal you and cleanse you.\n\nJesus said in John 6:37,\n\n> *”him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.”*\n\nJesus wants you to come.  *”Come ye who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.”* *”Come take of the water of life freely.”*\n\nCome to Jesus, and He promises He will not cast you out.  Jesus wants to heal sinners.\n\nSometimes I think the biggest barrier we face is we think God doesn’t want to heal sinners.  We think surely God wants to judge them. Surely God wants nothing to do with them.  Oh, maybe He picks one up once in a while to make the rest of them feel bad, but surely God doesn’t care about sinners.\n\nBut listen: God wants to see sinners cleansed far more than you or I ever could.  God so loved sinners He sent His only begotten Son to die for them.  Jesus didn’t come to condemn the world, but that the world through Him could be saved.  Jesus wants to save sinners.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe there is someone here this morning who is in their sin.  You’ve never been healed and cleansed by Jesus.  Maybe sin has wrecked your life.  Maybe sin has deformed you.  Maybe you feel like Jesus would never want to have anything to do with a disgusting sinner like you.\n\nBut Jesus says *”I will, be thou clean.”*\n\n## 4. Jesus healed Him\nVerse 42 says:\n\n> *”As soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed.”*\n\nImagine this man with me.  The disgusting sores withered away.  His fingers grew back.  He face went back to normal.  This awful disease was gone and gone forever.  He could go find his wife. He could find his children, and maybe for the first time in decades, he could give them a hug.\n\nHe was healed.  He was cleansed.\n\nHe had spent years shouting “Unclean! Unclean!” to anyone who came near. Now imagine him looking at his skin and feeling for the first time in forever. He’s not shouting, “Unclean! Unclean!” anymore. He’s shouting, “I’m clean! I’m clean!”\n\nThat’s what Jesus does.  That’s what He will do to you if you let Him, if you come to Him.\n\n> *”18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. 19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:”* (Isaiah 1:18,19)\n\nJesus is in the healing business.  He’s in the cleansing business.  He loves to take lepers and make them whole, and He’ll do it to you. \n\nIf you’ve never trusted Christ as your savior, why not do it today? He loves sinners so much He came to this world and died on the cross for your sins.  He took your punishment, and all He asks is that you come in faith and believe.  Come a sinner, and leave a saved man.  Come sick, and leave healed.  Come broken, and leave whole.\n\nWhy not come to Jesus this morning?\n\nI don’t like most contemporary Christian music, but there is this one song I’ve heard that I love the words to:\n\n```\n?\nWeak and wounded sinner, lost and left to die\nLift your head for love is passing by\nCome to Jesus.  Come to Jesus.  Come to Jesus\nand live.\n?\n```\n\nLet’s stand with heads bowed and eyes closed this morning.",

    "body": "Our text this morning is going to be Mark 1:14-15.  It’s another very short text.  At this rate, we will finish the book of Mark sometime before Noah finishes high school, but I don’t want to rush through this book, especially this introductory stuff.\n\nLet’s read those verses:\n\n> *”Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.”*\n\nJesus was a preacher.  In fact, He was the greatest preacher who ever lived.  He was a greater preacher than John the Baptist, than Elijah, than Jeremiah, or Isaiah.  He was a greater preacher than John Wesley, Charles Spurgeon, George Whitfield, Billy Sunday.  \n\nI remember my first sermon.  I was 17.  I had just answered the call to preach.  My youth pastor had me preach in our youth group on a Wednesday night—about 30 of my peers.  I guarantee you, if you could be a fly on the wall, it would have been the most pitiful thing you ever saw.  \n\nI remember standing behind that podium and having absolutely no idea what to say, stumbling and mumbling through some notes.  It felt like it took FOREVER.  It actually lasted 60 seconds.  \n\nPastor Sexton down at Crown College and Temple Baptist Church is one of the greatest preachers I’ve ever known.  God’s used him a lot.  His first ever sermon was on the radio.  He was 16.  Someone made a tape.  He was kind enough to send that tape to a bunch of us preachers.  It was unbelievably pitiful.  He mumbled and repeated himself and said the most obvious things over and over.  To me, that’s encouraging.  You can always improve.\n\nGolfers have this joke where they will say, “Good news! There is only two things wrong with your golf game: distance and accuracy.”  Sometimes I think, “Good news! There are only two things wrong with my preaching: content and delivery.”  I think, “If I could just get those two things down.”  \n\nMost preachers have to work at it.  We have to work on improvement.  It takes a while to “get it.”\n\nJesus “got it” right away.  Jesus’ first sermons weren’t pitiful.  They were awesome.  There was no YouTube when Jesus was alive, so we can’t analyze His delivery, but we know that people were awed.  Look at verse 22:\n\n> *”And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.”*\n\nThere are very few preachers who I’ve listened to who have left me “astonished.”  I can think of only a few, but I guarantee that if you were to put them up against Jesus, they would look like stammering and bumbling idiots.\n\nBut I don’t want to talk about Jesus’ delivery this morning, I want to talk about His **content**, because our text does something awesome for us:  **It summarizes the message of Jesus.**\n\nLook at the text again. It’s only two verses.  It won’t hurt us to read it again.\n\n> *”Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.”*\n\nBased on verse 15, I think Jesus’ message could be summarized as three things, and I think those three things are three things that still need to be preached today.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll jump right into this passage.**\n\nLike I said, I think Jesus’ message had three parts, and they are three parts we all need today.\n\nThe first part is...\n\n# 1. Listen\nLook at the text again, notice some of these phrases:\n* *”the gospel of the kingdom of God”*\n* *”the time is fulfilled”* \n* *”the kingdom of God is at hand.”*\n\nThe word “gospel” means “good news.”  It’s something to be proclaimed.  If you can imagine living before the age of television or the internet, and even before the age of the printing press, then imagine your country is at war.  How would you know if they won?  How would you know who won an election?  How would you know when the king died?  Someone would have to stand in the streets and proclaim the news.\n\nThat’s what the word “gospel” means.  It’s good news.  When that crier was shouting the good news, everyone would stop what they were doing to listen.  “Hush, I want to hear this. This is important.”  \n\nJesus wanted them to know that his message was an important message, and that it was urgent.   Jesus was saying, “Something big is coming. The time is now. You had better listen up, and you had better get ready.”\n\nSpecifically, what Jesus told them was that “the kingdom of God” was coming.\n\nSo let’s stop here and ask an important question: **what was the Kingdom of God?**\n\nI’ve been reading the prophets in my devotions lately, and there were a lot of prophecies about God restoring Israel.  Remember that during Jesus’ day, the Jews were living in the land here, but they are a fractured, conquered people.  They are under the heavy hand of the Romans.  \n\nBut I don’t think the primary thing Jesus was talking about here was a restoration of Jewish government.  I don’t think that’s what most of the Old Testament prophecies were about anyways.  I think there was a **spiritual emphasis** to this that they completely missed.\n\nLet’s look at a couple of passages this morning.  Turn to Ezekiel 36:24-27.\n\n> *”Ezekiel 36:24-27 (KJV) 24 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land. 25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you. 26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. 27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do [them].”*\n\n\nNotice the spiritual emphasis there.  It has a lot more to do with the heart of the people and their relationship with God than it does with kings, kingdoms, and land.\n\nLook at Jeremiah 24:7.\n\n> *”And I will give them an heart to know me, that I [am] the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.”*\n\nLook at chapter 31:33.\n\n> *”But this [shall be] the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.”*\n\nGod promised a restoration of the kingdom to the Jews, but He promised much, much more than that.  He promised a new heart; He promised a new spirit; He promised a restoration of their relationship; He promised that they would finally be His people indeed and not just in name.\n\nThere were lots of preachers in Jesus’ day who were talking about politics and kingdoms, but I don’t think that was ever the thrust of Jesus message.  I do think if the Jews hadn’t rejected Jesus, He may have setup his kingdom then, but I don’t think that was the thrust of Jesus’ message.  I think Jesus was telling people that they could be right with God, and that they could see these spiritual promises fulfilled in Him.\n\nWhat was the good news?  \n* The good news was they could have a relationship with God.  \n* The good news was they didn’t have to keep living in sin.  \n* The good news is that God wanted to help them and to make them a part of His people. God wasn’t just going to slap a band-aid on them. **He was going to give them new hearts.**\n\nListen, folks.  Today, 2000 years later, Jesus is still saying the same thing to us:  “Listen up.  Hear this.  I’m offering you a new heart.  I’m offering you a new way of living.  I’m offering to be your God.  You don’t have to live separated from me anymore.  There doesn’t have to be this rift in our relationship.  I’ve got good news: I’ve made a way for us to be reconciled. I can be your God, and you can be a part of my people.”\n\nGod can give you a new start and a new heart through Jesus.  That’s good news, but you have to hear it.  You have to put down your Facebook, turn off your Fox News or CNN, and stop worrying about the baseball game next weekend or the test next week.  You have to turn the noise off and listen.\n\nSo the first part of Jesus’ message was, “Listen.” Listen: the kingdom of God is at hand.  I’ve got good news.  Hear it.  Listen.\n\nThe second part of Jesus message was:\n\n# 2. Think\nLook at what Jesus says in verse 15 again:\n\n> *”The time is fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye.”*\n\nJesus said, “Listen,” and then He said, “Repent.”\n\nNow, there is a lot of confusion about this word “repent.”  The Catholic Church took this word over the years and they made it mean “to be sorry for.”  They added an emotional element to the word, but that’s not what Jesus was saying here.  The word “repent” just means “change your mind” or “think again.”\n\nIn Greek, the word “repent” here is “metanoāō.”  “Meta” means “change” like “metamorphosis.”  And “noāō” means “think” or “your thinking.”  So what this is literally saying is, “Change your thinking,” “Change your mind,” or “Rethink some things.”\n\nWhen Jesus says, “Repent ye,” He isn’t telling you to have some emotional experience where you blabber and cry and feel really, really bad about yourself.  He’s telling you to rethink some things.  He’s telling you to take a long, hard look at your life and how you are living, and rethink some things.\n\nHere are some things you need to rethink:\n\n**You need to rethink your relationship with God.**\n\nA lot of people assume that they are right with God.  They assume that “it’s all good with the man upstairs,”  or they assume that they are Christians just because of their culture or because of their heritage.\n\nBut that’s not what the Bible teaches us at all. The Bible teaches us that we are all sinners.  The Bible teaches us that we are all God’s enemies, and that there is this rift in our relationship with God.\n\nThe Bible says in Romans 8:7, *”The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.”*   \n\nNot only are you not “alright with the man upstairs,” but you can’t possibly be “alright with the man upstairs” unless you trust Christ as your Savior, because God requires perfection, and you can’t possibly do it.\n\n**You need to rethink your relationship with sin.**\n\nThe reason why no one is right with God is because God demands perfection.  God is 100% holy. God cannot have sin in his presence, and every one of us is, by nature, a sinner.  \n\n**Sin is anything we say, do or think that displeases God.** We can start with the Ten Commandments.  The one everyone goes to first is murder.  Okay,  I’ll give you that one, but can you honestly say you’ve never lied? Can you honestly say you’ve never taken anything that doesn’t belong to you?  \n\nYou know one of the Ten Commandments is coveting what belongs to someone else.  Can you honestly say you’ve never driven by the country club or seen some nice car and thought, “Why do they get that and not me?”\n\nAnd those are the easy ones.  The first of the Ten Commandments says, *“Thou shalt have no other gods before me.”*  \n\nWe are all sinners.  We all—if we are honest with ourselves—fail at God’s standards all the time.  We are sinners.\n\nThe Bible says, *”For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.”*\n\nYou are a sinner.  Your sin must be punished by a Holy God.  \n\nThe third thing you must re-think is...\n\n**You need to rethink your relationship with your own works.**\n\nMost people will admit that there is a God, and they will say they believe in heaven and hell, but if you ask most people if they are going to heaven, almost all of them will say, “Yes.”  Then if you ask them why, almost all of them will say the same thing again: “I’m a pretty good person.”\n\nMost people think that the way to get to heaven is to be a good person—To do more good works than bad works, and to try to keep the Ten Commandments.  And most people, if you give them this test, think they are passing it.\n\nThe Bible has something else to say.  The same verse that says, *“For all have sinned”* also says, *“and come short.”*   \n\nNo matter who you are, you aren’t going to be good enough to satisfy God’s demands.  You are going to come short.  \n\nI’ll use an illustration I’ve used many times before.  Imagine that you, me, and the world champion long jumper are going to try to jump across the Grand Canyon.  I go first. I set up and run my hardest.  I’m ready to give my very best jump, but I stumble on a rock at the edge and just sort of trip right into the Grand Canyon.  Then you go.  You set up.  You run hard.  You do your best jump ever.  You jump 40 feet.  That’s like jumping from this platform to the back wall.  That’s amazing.  The world champion goes last, he sets up and runs and jumps.  It’s an amazing jump.  80 feet.  He shatters the world record.  \n\nBut here is the thing: It doesn’t matter if you jump 1 foot, 40 feet, or 80 feet because the Grand Canyon is over a mile across, and all of us are dead.  All of us failed.\n\nYou aren’t going to be able to save yourself by works.  You might be an amazingly good person, but you aren’t sinlessly perfect.  You might be above average or you might be a derelict.  It doesn’t matter.  God’s standard is sinless perfection.  It’s a perfect 100 or it’s failure.  You don’t get in with a B+.\n\nThe Bible is so crystal clear about this.  Whole books of the Bible were written about this one point.  Galatians 2:16 says:\n\n> *”...by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.”*\n\nRomans 3:19-20 says this:\n\n> *”19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. 20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law [is] the knowledge of sin.”*\n\nSo to review, you need to understand some things, to rethink some things:\n* You are not good in God’s eyes by default.  There is a rift there, and that rift is caused because\n* You are a sinner in the eyes of a Holy God.\n* No matter how hard you try, you can’t save yourself.  You can’t do enough good works to save yourself.  \n\nListen - God wants to give you a new heart and a new start.\nThink - You are a sinner before God now who can’t save himself.\n\nLook at the third part of Jesus’ message...\n\n# 3. Believe\nJesus said in our text:\n\n> *”The time is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.”*\n\nLike I said, the word “gospel” means “good news.”  Jesus was saying, “Believe the good news.”\n\nI don’t think the people Jesus was preaching to totally understood the good news. They couldn’t see the whole picture yet, but we know what Jesus was ultimately referring to here.  The Bible tells us exactly what the gospel or the good news is.  Turn with me to 1 Corinthians 15.\n\nLook at verse 1:\n\n> *”For I delivered unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand: by which also ye are saved.”*\n\nSo Paul is talking about the gospel; the gospel that you have to receive and believe; the gospel that saves you.  What is it?\n\nLook at verse 3:\n\n> *”For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that the was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.”*\n\nThat is the gospel.  Jesus died for your sins.  Jesus was buried, and He rose again.\n\nIt’s very, very simple really.  Mankind has rejected God and chosen sin.  All of us are sinners.  God’s standard for heaven and a relationship with Him is sinless perfection.  No one can do that.\n\nYou need a 100, and no one gets a 100.\n\nSo Jesus did it for you.  Jesus took your punishment on the cross.  He lived the sinless and perfect life you couldn’t, and then was punished for your sins by a holy God on the cross.  Then he was buried and rose again in victory.\n\nThat’s the gospel, and God’s one requirement is that you believe it—that you put your faith and trust in it.\n\nYou have to let Jesus take the test for you, and you have to trust in what Jesus has done.  It’s so simple.\n\n```\n?\nHe paid a debt He did not owe \nI owed a debt I could not pay \nI needed someone to wash my sins away \nAnd now I sing a brand new song \nAmazing Grace \nChrist Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay\n?\n```\n\nThat’s the gospel.  That’s the good news, and all God asks you to do to be saved is believe it.  Trust in it.  Rest in it.  \n\n* He’ll give you a new start.\n* He’ll give you a new heart.\n* He’ll give you purpose.\n* He’ll give you a new spiritual family.\n* He’ll wipe your slate clean.\n* He’ll give you power over sin.\n\nListen.  Think.  Believe.\n\nThat’s what it’s all about folks.  \n\nHave you ever believed the gospel?  Has there been a time in your life when you trusted Christ as your savior?  For me it was when I was a fourteen-year-old boy. I knew all about church.  I could quote every verse, but I knew in my heart that I was lost. I knew I was a sinner. I got down beside my bed one night, and I asked Jesus to save me and believed the gospel.  \n\nBells didn’t ring.  Lights didn’t flash.  I didn’t tingle all over, but I believed the gospel and God started changing me.\n\nHow about you?  When did you trust Christ?  \n\nLet’s all stand with every head bowed and every eye closed.\n\n",

    "body": "# Show of Force (Mark 1:21-35)\nSince I started this series on Mark, I’ve been doing a bunch of one or two verse sermons.  I’m glad to say, our text this morning is finally going to be more than one or two verses.  We are going to read Mark 1:21-35.  Please turn there, and we’ll read these verses together.\n\n> *”Mark 1:21-35 (KJV) 21 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught. 22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes. 23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 24 Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God. 25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. 26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. 27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him. 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee. 29 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. 30 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her. 31 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them. 32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils. 33 And all the city was gathered together at the door. 34 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. 35 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.”*\n\nI don’t watch or read the news anymore.  Anything that tries to get my attention on a day to day basis—whether it’s facebook, podcasts, radio shows, TV, or blog posts—I don’t do it.  I figure if it’s important enough, someone else will tell me about it.  I’ve just been trying to focus on my preaching and work.\n\nBut in researching this sermon, I learned that there has been a weird subject in the news lately: military parades.  Apparently, President Trump wants to have a big military parade— a show of force — in Washington D.C. Because President Trump is President Trump and he’s trying to do *anything*, the Democrats are opposed to it.\n\nI spent seven years of my childhood in the D.C. area and I remember going to a big military shindig when I was down there.  It wasn’t a parade, it was in a stadium, but it was the same idea.  There is nothing like the pomp and circumstance of a military parade: Men marching in order in full uniform and airplanes flying overhead.  If you are into that sort of thing, it can be beautiful and patriotic.\n\nBut a military parade has a second purpose besides just pomp and circumstance and patriotism: It says to the world, “Don’t mess with us, or we will wipe you off the map,” or, “We have power, and we aren’t afraid to use it.”\n\nOur text this morning is like a show of force for Jesus.  Jesus is parading His power here.  He is showing the world and the devil that He isn’t to be messed with.\n\nI sang that song this morning, “There is Power in the Name of Jesus.”  I LOVE that song.  It gets me every time I hear it.  It’s a little over the top, but the message is amazing.  \n\nI believe that Jesus has power to change lives. I believe that Jesus has power to heal, and I believe that Jesus has power to show us the truth.  If He doesn’t, then why are we here?  What’s the point?  Jesus has power and I couldn’t think of a better song to go with this message than that.\n\nSo in these verses we are going to see the power of Jesus in four ways.  Let’s pray, and we’ll jump right into them.\n\nThe first way Jesus showed power in this text is...\n\n# 1. Jesus showed His power as a Preacher\nLook at verse 21:\n\n> *”And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.”*\n\nThe Jews had the temple, and before that, they had the tabernacle.   That is where the priests worked.  That is where the ark of the covenant was.  That was where all of the offerings were made.\n\nBut there was only one temple, and it was only in one place: Jerusalem.  So it’s not like you could go to the Temple every week.  Especially if you didn’t live in Jerusalem.  \n\nSo the jews of Jesus day had a second religious institution that was actually much more influential than the temple, and there was one of these in every town and village: the synagogue. \n\nThe synagogue was much closer to a local church as we know it today than the temple was.  Every sabbath, the faithful Jews would go to the synagogue, and it went something like this:\n\n* There would be some kind of reading of Psalms\n* There would be some kind of benediction.\n* There would be an offering.\n* Someone would read a prescribed portion of scripture for everyone to hear.\n* Then someone would get up and teach or preach.\n\nThere was one major difference between a church and a synagogue: they didn’t have set pastors.  Anybody was welcome to teach there.  The gospels teach us that Jesus customarily took advantage of this and preached in synagogues whenever there was an opportunity.\n\nNow this passage doesn’t tell us *what* Jesus preached, and it doesn’t tell us *how* Jesus preached. It just tells us the effect it had on people.\n\nLook at verse 22:\n\n> *”And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.”*\n\nThe preachers and teachers the people were used to listening to were in love with quotation marks.  They wouldn’t come out and say anything.  It was always “According to Gamaliel,” “According to Halel,” or “So and so says.”   Listening to them preach was like reading the bibliography of an encyclopedia.  As Noah would say, *”Boring!”*\n\nAnd it wasn’t at all clear that these scribes and Pharisees who preached to them believed what they were saying.  They didn’t know what they were talking about, and they didn’t really live it.  It was just going through the motions, dry formalism, and an empty intellectual exercise.\n\nYou do know, church, that it is possible to be as straight as a gun barrel doctrinally and religiously, and be as empty as one, too.  You do know that there are hundred of thousands of modern day scribes and Pharisees going through the motions every week and reheating someone else’s message.\n\nI get an email almost every day from a guy trying to sell me someone else’s sermons.  At Easter, it was “Twelve amazing Easter sermons”, and this week, it’s “Quick and easy Mother’s Day sermons.”  I’m not kidding.  \n\nThen there are preachers who are so educated and self-important that they are bringing theological arguments every week that no one understands.  I’m not at all against education, training, and study, but you don’t need a one-hour lecture on the hypostatic union or the marrow controversy every week. You need the word of God.\n\nSo just like today, there were all of these churches, and most of them were full of scribes with powerless messages.\n\nBut when Jesus preached, they were *astonished at his doctrine.* Those words mean it was like they were punched in the gut.  It was powerful.  Jesus didn’t beat around the bush.   Jesus cut to the brass tacks.  Jesus spoke in a way that they understood.  Jesus preached the clear and unadulterated truth of God’s word, but most of all, Jesus spoke with power and authority because He lived His message.\n\nAnd they were gut-punched.  They were astonished.  \n\n**God still uses powerful, authoritative preaching to change lives.**  I can speak with personal testimony that preaching has changed my life.  Preaching has convicted me.  Preaching has altered my path.  Preaching has built me up and challenged me week to week.\n\nI’ve seen preaching break through the hearts of hard people.  I’ve seen Jesus get a hold of people.  I’ve seen Jesus put families back together.  I’ve seen Jesus clean up drunks.  I’ve seen Jesus erase prejudices.  I’ve seen Jesus wipe out bitterness.  People are made over again when Jesus is preached with power.\n\nSo Jesus preached with power.  Wouldn’t you like to have been there, listening to it, watching it, feeling it?  Wouldn’t you like to see the light of Christ break through on people and the Holy Spirit change their lives?  Maybe He’d convict you.  It would be awesome to see.  Maybe when we get to heaven, we’ll find the home video and watch a replay.\n\n---\n\nBut you know what?  \n\nIf you were watching this, it wasn’t a peaceful service.  It wasn’t a quiet service because Jesus’ power and light were met with demonic opposition.  \n\nLook at verse 23:\n\n> *”And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, saying, Let us alone!”*\n\nThere was a man in this synagogue who was demon-possessed.  He was controlled by a demon: Hard-hearted, past feeling, tormented, and demon-possessed.\n\nAnd get this: He was in church!  \n\nLikely, this man had been in this synagogue for a long time.  Likely, no one had noticed him much. They might have said, “That guy’s a grump,” or, “That guy is a jerk.”  But they didn’t give it much thought.\n\nThe preaching didn’t bother him.  He could listen to the dry scribes and Pharisees all day.\n\nBut when Jesus showed up, this demon made a ruckus.  \n\nListen, when Jesus shows up, He’s a destructive force against the power of Satan.  He’s going to turn over the couches. He’s going to shine a light into the corners. Things that lay dormant in your life and things that have been swept under the rug are going to come into His light, and the devil is going to resist that.  He’s going to say, “Let us alone!”\n\nBut notice what Jesus does. He just rebukes the demon.  There were exorcists in Jesus day and it was all a big hubbub.  But with Jesus, there was no chant,  no elaborate exorcism ceremony, and no candles.  He just rebukes Him and says, *”Hold thy peace and come out of him.”*   Jesus told that demon to shut his mouth and find a new place to live.  He gave him his eviction papers, and right there, with everyone watching, that demon-possessed man convulsed, shook, screamed, and shrieked, but the demon came out of him.\n\nSo the second power Jesus showed in this story was...\n\n# 2. Jesus showed His power over demons\nListen, folks: Jesus is a destructive force against the powers of darkness.  He’s a steamroller.  He’s a Sherman tank.  It’s no contest. Jesus is always going to win that fight.\n\nThe light will always win against the darkness.\n\nI remember one time when I was a teenager, I got lost in this giant cave.  I had to be rescued.  I sat for a long time in the pitch dark.  I mean, you’ve never seen dark like this.  There was no light anywhere.  The dark was oppressive and scary.  You couldn’t get away from it, but that darkness had no power over light.  It couldn’t put out the tiniest little LED.  \n\nThe world and the powers of darkness might seem like they are everywhere and they are powerful, but they can’t put out the light. All Jesus needs to do is shine in their direction, and they are toast.\n\nI don’t think born-again Christians *can* be demon-possessed, but you might still feel the power of darkness in your life.   Let me tell you: It’s no match for Jesus.  There is going to be a struggle.  The darkness won’t go without a fight, but it’s going to lose.  You can mark it down.\n\nJesus has complete power over demons.\n\nSo we’ve seen Jesus power in preaching and His power over darkness.\n\nLook at the third thing...\n\n# 3. Jesus showed His power over sickness\nIn the next little part of this story, Jesus goes to Peter’s house and heals Peter’s mother-in-law.  She was sick with a fever.  It was probably nothing life-threatening; she was just incapacitated.  It probably came on suddenly.\n\nJesus just walked up to her bed, held her hand, rebuked the sickness, and lifted her up, and she was good as new.  She got right up and set the table.\n\nLater on (they waited until sunset because it was the sabbath), everyone in town who was sick came to Jesus to be healed, and He healed them all.  Verses 33-34 say:\n\n> *”And all the city was gathered together at the door.  And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.”*\n\nThat’s a show of force right there.  Jesus was just healing everyone.\n\nI believe that Jesus still has the power to heal diseases, don’t you?  I believe He has power over sickness.  We are still commanded to anoint the sick with oil and pray over them.  \n\nThere is power in Jesus’ name.\n\n---\n\n\nSo think about this day: Jesus has preached with power, He’s cast out demons,  and He’s healed many people.  A big part of His healing didn’t start till after sunset. It had to be a very late night and Jesus had to  be exhausted.\n\nSometimes ministry is exhausting.  Sometimes I’m not much fun at Sunday afternoon lunch, and I’m usually very tired on Mondays.  Preaching wears me out.  Just the emotion of it.  Can you imagine how tired Jesus was? I’d imagine He wanted to sleep in on Sunday morning after this exhausting sabbath day.\n\nBut look what he does in verse 35:\n\n> *“And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.”*\n\nJesus woke up early while everyone else was still sleeping, and long before the sun was up, He tiptoed out of the house, walked outside of town, found a quiet place where He could be alone, and He talked to God.\n\nThe last place where we see Jesus power is...\n\n# 4. Jesus showed His power in Prayer\nJesus needed prayer and quiet time more than He needed sleep.  He needed to get alone with God.  I don’t understand this, but I think Jesus needed His spiritual batteries recharged. The only place that happens is in quiet time with God.\n\nListen, we are never going to have power like Jesus had, but if we want Jesus to be powerful in our life, we need to learn from Him, get up, and find some quiet time to talk to God.  \n\n```\n?\nMy quiet time alone\nGives me power to obey\nMy quiet time alone with God each day\nI go to him in prayer\nEvery day he meets me there\nMy quiet time alone, with God\n```\n\nQuiet time is powerful.  Prayer is powerful.  Are you making time to get alone with Jesus?\n\nChurch, there is power in the name of Jesus.  Jesus is powerful.  His truth is powerful.  He has power over demons and darkness.  He has power over sickness.  \n\nHe is just as powerful today as He was in the Bible.  He’s the same God.  *”Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and forever.”*\n\nSo the question is: **Is Jesus powerful in your life?**  \n\n* Are you letting His word speak to you?  \n* Are you letting Him destroy the powers of darkness in your life?  \n* Are you letting Him look under the rug and turn over the couch?  \n* Are you finding time to get alone with Him?\n\nThe world doesn’t need more clever gimmicks and slick church programs.  The world doesn’t need more of us.  The world needs more of Jesus.  The world needs to see Jesus working powerfully through us.\n\nAre you letting Him work powerfully through you?\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "# Jesus Under Pressure (Mark 3:7-19)\nI want to show you something.  I got this for my wife for our last anniversary.  Anyone know what this is?  It’s called an instant pot.  Have you heard of these?  They’re magical.\n\nI can throw a rack of ribs in this thing with some rub and a little water, and fifteen minutes later, they are falling off the bone like they’ve been slow-cooked for a full day.  I can make beef stew in twenty minutes.  I can make hot wings in thirty minutes.  I used to wonder what it was like when people first used a microwave—how amazing that must have seemed. That’s what this thing is like.\n\nBut it’s actually nothing new.  It’s just a new twist on a very old tool.  It’s just an electric pressure cooker.  \n\nPressure, as it turns out, can do some crazy things:  \n\n* Pressure can turn a meal that would take hours to cook in a crock pot into a thirty minute deal.  \n* Pressure can turn carbon, the most common substance on earth, into diamonds, one of the rarest.  \n* Scientists can take ordinary substances in a lab and put them under extreme pressure to create extraordinary substances like Kevlar.\n\n**Pressure can do amazing things...but it can also crush you.** \n\nVery often in life we have to deal with pressure:\n\n* The pressure of the modern workplace where your boss expects you to put work first or your coworkers seem out to get you.\n* The pressure of financial strains where it seems like there is always way too much month left at the end of your money.\n* The pressure of family and relationships where you are always dealing with other people’s baggage and trying desperately to help people who don’t want to be helped.\n* The pressure to be a certain kind of person to fit in with society.\n* The pressure we feel when we look on Facebook or Instagram and we see how great everyone else’s life looks.\n* The pressure of our own ambitions where we are always feeling like we have to be someone or do something and that we aren’t living up to it.\n* The pressure of failing health or the failing health of a loved one.\n\nSometimes we feel like we are the ones in the instant pot.\n\nIn our text this morning, you are going to see that Jesus was under a lot of pressure, too.  In fact, He was under pressure from every side—pressure that you and I can’t even imagine.  \n\nThat’s encouraging, isn’t it?  Remember, Hebrews 4:15 says:\n\n> *”For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.”**\n\nJesus knows what it is like to be under pressure.  He knows what stress feels like.  We can cast all our cares on Jesus because He cares for us, but we can also know that He knows what those cares are like.\n\nLet’s read Mark 3:7-19 this morning:\n\n> *”7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, 8 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him. 9 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 10 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues. 11 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 12 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.”*\n\n> *”13 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth [unto him] whom he would: and they came unto him. 14 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 15 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils: 16 And Simon he surnamed Peter; 17 And James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder: 18 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite, 19 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.”*\n\nI’m going to give you three points from this story this morning.  We are going to talk about the pressure Jesus was under, the plan Jesus put in place, and the rest Jesus gives.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll get into that.**\n\nThe first point I want to give you is...\n\n## 1. The pressure Jesus was under.\n\nIn this passage, Jesus was under an insane amount of pressure.  First, He was dealing with...\n\n### A. Pressure from the Pharisees.\n\nThat’s what we’ve talked about for the last four weeks, and that definitely carries over into this story.  Everywhere Jesus went there were these leaders who were trying to trip Him up and catch Him in His words.  All of the leaders of the land, even though they hated each other, were banded together to destroy Jesus.  Eventually, they would put Jesus on the cross.\n\nAfter this point, Jesus probably knew it was too hot for Him in the synagogues, so He didn’t go there anymore, and He preached instead in the open fields.\n\nSecond, Jesus was dealing with...\n\n### B. Pressure from the crowds.\n\nVerse 7 says: \n\n> *”And a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan, and they about Tyre and Sidon.”*\n\nPeople were coming from everywhere, and I mean everywhere.  \n\nRemember: There were no phones.  There was no Facebook.  This is 100% word of mouth.  Remember: There were no cars.  Some of these people traveled a hundred miles ON FOOT to see Jesus.\n\nAnd it’s nuts.  It’s like the president is in town or fireworks up at Arthur.  Where did all of these people come from?  There are people everywhere, and they are all trying to get to Jesus.  They want Jesus to heal them.\n\nThe text tells us Jesus is preaching up against a lake here, and that it was so bad that Jesus had to have a boat ready in case they stampeded Him so He could jump in the boat and get away from people.  All of these sick people are literally trying to touch Him and getting right up in His space.\n\nThat’s pressure.\n\nYou’ve probably figured this out about me by now, but I’m kind of an introvert.  I don’t do crowds.  I like my quiet office.  I don’t do a lot of parties because it drains me.  My wife is the opposite. She’ll come out of a party all excited and energized.  She thrives on social contact, but social interaction wears me out.\n\nI’m just imagining myself in Jesus’ shoes here, and it sounds absolutely exhausting.  Jesus wasn’t just talking to them; He was healing them.  \n\nThat’s crazy pressure.\n\nLastly, Jesus faced...\n\n### C. Pressure from the forces of darkness.\n\nNot only were huge crowds of people pushing themselves on Jesus, but demon-possessed people were there, too, and they were trying to out Jesus as the Son of God before He was ready.  In the ancient world, there was this belief that if you named something, you’d have some kind of power over it, and that is what the demons seem like they are doing here.  It’s an all-out war.\n\nSo picture the scene: Pharisees waiting, lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce; huge, massive crowds of people pressing in on Jesus; demon-possessed people shouting eerie messages at Him.\n\nIt’s nonstop pressure.\n\nNow listen: I know you are under stress, but I highly doubt the most powerful people in the country are plotting together to kill you.  I know you are under stress, but I doubt you have thousands of people from all over the world thronging you and demanding every last second of your time and privacy.  I know you are under stress, but I doubt very seriously you have demons chasing you around shouting at you.\n\nThat is pressure.  That is pressure you and I will never have to deal with.\n\nSo what did Jesus do about it?\n\nLet me give you the second point:\n\n## 2. The plan Jesus put in place\n\nHow did Jesus handle stress?  Is there a lesson in here for us?  Look at verse 13:\n\n> *”And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.”*\n\nJesus did two things to take care of stress.  First...\n\n### A. He came apart\n\nSeveral times in the gospels, it tells us that Jesus “came apart.”  That means Jesus went into a place of solitude to be alone and to be alone with God.\n\nSometimes, when the stresses of life are tearing you apart, what you need is to come apart.  You need to get away.  You need to spend some time with God.  You need to put the smartphone away and turn off the TV.  Stop answering the phone calls and just get alone with God.\n\nThe old time preacher Vance Havner used to say, \n\n> “Come apart or you will come apart.” \n\nAnd it’s true.  \n\nThe parallel to this passage is Luke 6:12.  It says:\n\n> *”And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God.”*\n\nLet me tell you something:  We have never had more time-saving devices.  We have microwaves and instant pots.  We have vacuum cleaners and smartphones and smart watches.  We can say, “Hey Google, how many milliliters are in a teaspoon?” and a little speaker will answer us.  We have so many time-saving devices, and yet we’ve never had less time.\n\nThe key to “coming apart” is you have to make it happen.  You have to prioritize it.  There will always be little things that suck up your time if you don’t block off a set period of time and say, “This has to happen.”\n\nSo Jesus came apart.  But there is a second thing Jesus did here...\n\n### B. He came together\n\nJesus didn’t just spend time in solitude humming and meditating; He came together...\n\n#### I. With God\n\nHe spent deliberate time in prayer.  This is one of the most amazing things about Jesus.  He was God in the flesh.  He was 100% God and 100% man, but He still needed to spend time alone with God in prayer.\n\nIf Jesus needed to spend time alone with God in prayer, how much more do we?\n\nSo often we rush into our day, and we let the cares of this world take over us and press us. However, we never take even fifteen minutes to spend time alone with God.\n\nIn Luke, it says that Jesus tarried all night in prayer.  He had to be exhausted from the pressures He was facing, but He knew that, more than He needed sleep, He needed power from on high.\n\nPrayer aligns our mind with the mind of God.  Prayer helps us to unload the cares and the burdens that weigh us down.  Prayer helps us tap into God’s power.  We need prayer.\n\nYou can spend all day trying to cut a tree with a dull axe, or you can spend a bit of time getting its edge sharp first and save yourself a lot of wasted time and effort.  A lot of us (myself included) spend a ton of time trying to do God’s work, and we are chopping away with a dull axe because we haven’t tapped into God’s power through prayer.\n\nSo Jesus came together with God, but Jesus also came together...\n\n#### II. With God’s People\n\nThe text says that He called His disciples to Him.  He got alone with God, and He got alone with God’s people.\n\nFellowship is another remedy to the pressures of this life.   We need to be around each other.\n\nThe Bible says about Jesus: *”Casting all your care upon him, for He careth for you.”* But it also says, *”Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.”*\n\nThere is something refreshing about true Christian fellowship.  Listen: If you just come to church on Sunday morning and you listen to a sermon, but you never spend time with these people through the week or never sit across the table from these people and share life with them, you are really missing out.\n\nChristianity was never intended to be a solo sport. It’s a team activity, and your local church is the team.  \n\nIf you’ve ever been to an evening service here, you’d see that it’s very common for people to hang out after the service for an hour.  If you come to our Sunday School classes, you’d hear a lot of laughter and talking.  That’s a good thing!  That’s as much a part of Christian ministry as the preaching is.  Really, that should spill over into meals together and activities.\n\nYou need fellowship.  It’s important.  These folks will remind you of what’s important.  They will lift your burdens to God in prayer.  They’ll share your really happy moments.  They’ll remind you that you aren’t in this alone.\n\nBut it goes beyond just fellowship.  Jesus came apart and then came together with God and with God’s people.  But He also came together...\n\n#### III. for shared responsibility\n \nJesus died for the sins of the whole world, and Jesus hears the prayers of the whole world.  I don’t want to downplay Jesus’ power at all.  He’s all-knowing, all-powerful, and everywhere-present.  He’s God.\n\nBut it was never Jesus’ intention to minister to everyone personally in a human sense.  If you look at Jesus’ ministry, He spent a huge amount of His time training others to do and to carry on the work.  \n\nAnd here is an important point for us to remember: We can’t do it all by ourselves.  In fact, it’s foolish for us to try to do it all by ourselves.  We need help. \n\nJesus’ plan was always to share his work with His people.\n\nJesus came to *”seek and to save that which was lost.”*Jesus came to preach the gospel to every creature.  And when Jesus rose into the clouds in Acts 1, He left us—the Christians He left behind—with the job of carrying on His work.\n\nJesus trained twelve very ordinary men.  Most were fishermen.  One was a saved tax collector.  One was a political zealot who was converted to Christ.  We don’t know much about many of them, but we do know they were ordinary.  Jesus gave them a job to do: *”Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.”*\n\nAnd listen: It’s the same job we still have to this day.  It’s our job.  There are people in our town who don’t know the gospel, and it’s our job to tell them.  There are people in our state who don’t know the gospel, and it’s our job to tell them.  There are people around the world who have never heard the gospel, and it’s our job to tell them.\n\nWhen you become a part of the family of God, you become a part-owner of the family business, and the family business is preaching the gospel and starting churches.  That’s not just the job of pastors, missionaries, and evangelists; it’s the job of every believer.\n\nSo Jesus came apart from the crowds and the stress, and then He gave His disciples their marching orders.  He was trying to multiply his work by His twelve disciples, sending them out to do what He was doing.\n\nSo we’ve seen the pressure Jesus was under, and we’ve seen the plan that Jesus enacted, but let me make one more point before I close and that is...\n\n## 3. The peace Jesus gives\n\nSo many of us are under pressure.  We are stressed out.  Our whole world is stressed out.\n\n* Stress from work.\n* Stress from your family.\n* Stress from your health.\n* Stress from your bills.\n\nIt’s like everywhere we look we find stress.  We find pressure.  \n\nAnd we can look in this passage, and we can see that Jesus had pressure, too.  He had more pressure than we ever have to deal with, but I also want you to understand this about Jesus: He is the answer to our pressure.  Jesus came so that we can trade pressure for peace.  \n\nPhilippians 4:7 says:\n\n> *”And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.”*\n\nColossians 3:15 says:\n\n> *”And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.”*\n\nI could just read about a dozen Bible verses like that.  The most common greeting in the New Testament is, “Grace and Peace Be with You.”\n\nJesus came so that we could have peace.  \n\nThere is this old song we used to sing:\n\n> ”? With Christ in the vessel you can smile at the storm. ?”\n\nJesus dealt with pressure so that we can have peace, and one thing about Jesus is that no matter how much pressure he was under, He still had peace. \n\nSo what is this peace that Jesus gives us?  It’s several things.  It is first and foremost:\n\n### A. Peace with God\n\nAll around the world, people believe in God, and universally, they believe that God is angry with them.  God must be appeased.\n\nThe Bible teaches the reason for that: Sin.  Sin alienates us from God.\n\nBut Jesus came to this earth and lived a perfect sinless life, and then Jesus died on the cross for our sins and God poured out His wrath—the wrath we deserved—on Jesus.  Because of that, through Jesus, we can have peace.   We can be reconciled.\n\nAnd here is what that means, it means you can have...\n\n### B. Peace with Yourself\n\nSo much of our stress is self-inflicted.  It is us trying to measure up.  It is us trying to be good enough.  \n\nThat’s the worst kind of pressure.  It’s relentless.  It never lets up.\n\nYou check your own performance every day.  Every minute.  Every hour.  Did I read my Bible enough?  Did I spend enough time with my wife?  With my kids?  Did I get enough done?  Did I work out enough?  Am I skinny enough?  Am I strong enough?  Am I accomplishing enough?  Am I just another loser?\n\nWe play this game in our minds over and over and over, day in and day out.  Constantly putting ourselves on trial.\n\nListen, do you know what Jesus says to us: you are not on trial.  You are not on trial because Jesus already went on trial for you and He was accepted.  It’s not about your performance.  Jesus says: You are accepted.  Through me, you are good enough.  Through me, you do measure up.  It’s not all on your shoulders; it was on My shoulders.  \n\nThat right there helps with the pressure a lot.\n\nBecause of Jesus, you can have peace with God, you can have peace with yourself, you can have...\n\n### C. Peace with rest\n\n Jesus said in Matthew 11:28,\n\n> *”Come unto me, all [ye] that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”*\n\nMost people are living this hamster-wheel existence: Work, work, work, work, work.\n\nWork to be good enough or live with the constant shame of not measuring up.\n\nJesus says, *“Come unto me, and I will give you rest.”*\n\nWe can rest in Jesus because He did the work.  We don’t have to measure up because He lived the perfect life.  We are accepted by God because of Him.  \n\nThe next verse says:\n\n> *”take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls.  For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”*\n\nYou can do it yourself, or you can rest in Jesus.  You can run on the never-ending hamster wheel, trying to appease the gods of money, fame, beauty, and comfort, or you can rest in Jesus.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nLet me wrap this up:  Some of you are under a lot of pressure.  I know it.  You feel like you are in this instant pot.\n\nSome of you need to come apart.  You need to get away from the hustle and bustle and spend some time with God.  You need to get out of the rat race and spend some time in fellowship.\n\nSome of you are still trying to work your way to God.  You are trying to save yourself.  It’s futile.  It’s depressing.  You need to accept Christ and what He had done for you.  You need to be saved.\n\nAll of us need to realize that Jesus is the answer to our pressure and that Jesus wants us to live at peace.  We can have peace because He is in control and we can have peace because Jesus earned it for us.\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "# Mark 1:2-11 - John the Baptist\nMuhammad Ali died in 2016.  His self-proclaimed title was “the greatest.”  He certainly was a great boxer, maybe even the greatest boxer ever, but Muhammad Ali thought he was bigger than boxing.  He just thought he was “the greatest” and would tell anyone who would listen.\n\nMy favorite Muhammad Ali story (which probably isn’t true) is that one time he was traveling on an airplane, and the stewardess scolded him for not wearing his seatbelt.  Muhammad Ali said, “Superman don’t need no seatbelt,”  and the stewardess, quick on her feet, said back to him, “Yes, but Superman don’t need no airplane either.”  \n\nWho actually was “the greatest”?  It wasn’t Muhammad Ali.  **As a Christian, I believe the greatest was Jesus Christ**.  Actually, I don’t think it’s even close.  There isn’t even a close second.  It’s Jesus up here, and then way, way down here someone is number two.  But besides Jesus, who was the greatest, and how do we be great?\n\nThe passage I’m going to preach from this morning in the book of Mark is about a man that Jesus said was the greatest.  In Matthew 11:11, Jesus said this:\n\n> *”Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.”*\n\nJesus said that the greatest up until that time was John the Baptist.\n\nLet’s read Mark 1:1-11:\n\n> *”Mark 1:1-11 (KJV) 1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God; 2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. 4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins. 5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. 6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey; 7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. 8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. 9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan. 10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: 11 And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”*\n\n---\n\nRemember, Mark is the “Cliff Notes gospel.”  It’s short, sweet, and to the point.  It starts the story of Jesus where most of the people who were alive at the time would: When Jesus broke onto the public scene and started his ministry.\n\nJesus’ ministry didn’t just come out of nowhere. Most of Jesus’ disciples and much of the crowd that came to hear Jesus speak were devotees of Jesus’ cousin, John the Baptist.  So Mark starts by telling us about John the Baptist.\n\n# Survey of the text\nWhat I want to do this morning is to take a few minutes and just walk through these verses and see what they teach us about John the Baptist. Then I’m going to make some points of application about how they apply to us.\n\nLet’s start with seven things this passage teaches us about John the Baptist:\n\nThe first thing we see about John is...\n\n## 1. John the Baptist’s prophetic foretelling\n\nVerse 2 says *”As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.”*\n\nThis is a quote from Malachi 3:1, where the prophet foretold a messenger that would prepare the way for the Messiah.  He was supposed to come in *”the spirit of Elijah”* and be a voice and a messenger.\n\nWhich brings us to the second thing this passage teaches us about John the Baptist...\n\n## 2. John the Baptist’s purpose\n\nVerse 3 says:  \n\n> *”The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.”*\n\nJohn’s purpose was to prepare people for Jesus.  He was just a voice—a voice whose main job was to say, “Get ready! Get ready! Get ready! Messiah is coming! You’d better get ready! You’d better get your life in order! You’d better get your heart right! Messiah is coming!”\n\nAnd that’s just what John did.  Look at: \n\n## 3. John the Baptist’s preaching and practice\nVerse 4 says:\n\n> *”John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.”*\n\nNow this is interesting, and I want to stop and explain this for a second.  John was baptizing.\n\nBaptize is just a Greek word that means “dunk.”  It means “to immerse in water.”\n\nJohn didn’t invent baptism.  The Jews baptized.  Gentiles could actually become Jews.  They called them proselytes.  In order for a Gentile to become a proselyte, they had to do two things:  They had to be circumcised, and they had to be baptized. The baptism was a ceremonial cleansing of their sins.\n\nSo why was John baptizing Jews?  I think what he was doing was preaching to them that there was more to being a Jew than just being a Jew.  I think he was preaching that there was a spiritual Israel and a carnal, fleshly Israel. If they wanted to be a part of the God’s people in the true spiritual sense, then they had to believe God and the Messiah, and take care of their sins. Baptism was just a picture of that.\n\nThe fourth thing we see in this passage about John the Baptist is...\n\n## 4. John the Baptist’s popularity\n\nVerse 5 says,\n\n> *”And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan.”*\n\nJohn the Baptist was amazingly popular.  Huge crowds of people came to hear him preach, and vast groups of people responded to his message and were baptized.\n\nHe was so popular that later on, Herod the king was afraid to do anything to John the Baptist because he thought it might start a revolution.  John the Baptist was the first mass evangelist.  Long before John Wesley, George Whitfield, D. L. Moody, Billy Sunday, and Billy Graham, people were making a special trip to hear John the Baptist preach.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, maybe part of it was the fifth thing this passage teaches us about John...\n\n## 5. John’s peculiar lifestyle \nLook at verse 6:\n\n> *”And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;”*\n\nThere are actually three weird things about John.  \n\nThe first is the place he lived.  He lived in the wilderness, way out in the desert where nobody wanted to visit, never mind live.  I mean, this was a scary place with cracked, parched ground.  Sometimes, smoke would even come out of the ground.  So when John preached about hell, people didn’t have to think too hard to imagine it.  It was desolate. There was no Walmart out there.  \n\nThe second weird thing about John was what he wore.  He wore a coat of camel’s hair and a leather girdle.  Now, the significant things about this outfit were that no one else dressed this way, and that it was the way that Elijah used to dress.  So by dressing this way, John the Baptist was identifying with Elijah of old.  It would be like if I stood up and preached this morning in a robe like they wore in Bible times.  It was weird.\n\nThe third weird thing about John was what he ate.  He ate locusts and wild honey.  The idea behind his food is that he ate as simply as possible; nothing fancy.  He just ate what was available to him.  \n\nSo this guy isn’t like everyone else.  His entire life is set up so that he’s different.  He eats differently, lives differently, dresses differently, and people had to go and see him.  He was a powerful preacher, but he also was a curiosity.  He was a freak.  \n\nSo we’ve seen John’s prophetic foretelling, his purpose, his preaching, his popularity, his peculiar lifestyle.  Look at the sixth thing:\n\n## 6. John’s pervasive humility\n\nVerse 7 says:\n\n> *”And preached saying, there cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.  I indeed baptize you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.”*\n\nI think this is really where we see what made John the Baptist so special. John the Baptist realized that his role in life was just to point the way to the Messiah.  Even as popular as John the Baptist was, it wasn’t ever about John the Baptist; it was about Jesus.  \n\nIn John 3:30, John the Baptist said, *”He must increase, but I must decrease.”* That seems to be his motto.  Just point people to Jesus.  He deflected all attention off of him to Jesus.\n\nAnd that brings us to...\n\n## 7. John’s pinnacle \n\nThe greatest moment of John’s life is found here in verses 9-11, where Jesus comes to John in the wilderness to be baptized.\n\nMark doesn’t tell us this, but we see it in other gospels. John immediately recognized Jesus and said, “You should be baptizing me,” but Jesus insisted and John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.  \n\nThen God spoke out of heaven and said, *“Thou art my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”*\n\nFrom this point in the story, John fades away, and it is all about Jesus. Jesus’ ministry starts with a bang.\n\n---\n\nSo that’s John the Baptist.  That’s a summary of the man that Jesus called the greatest who had ever lived at that point.  That makes John the Baptist greater than Abraham, greater than Moses, greater than Joshua, greater than Elijah.\n\nWhat I want to do for my last few minutes this morning is to talk about how we can be great like John in the eyes of God.  In God’s eyes, what makes a great life?  I think we can see four things about John’s life in these verses that answer that question and tell us what God thinks is great.\n\n# What it means to be great...\nThe first thing is...\n\n## 1. If you want to be great in the eyes of God, live in the will of God.\n\nJohn’s entire life, from his birth to his dress to his choice of a home to his choice of profession—all of it—it was all dedicated to God’s will for Him.  You see, God told John’s father and mother that he was going to be a prophet that prepared people for the Messiah.  Before John was even born, God had a will and a plan for him—to prepare people for Jesus—but John still had to submit to that will and plan.\n\nAnd let me tell you: If you are a Christian, God has a will and a plan for your life.  God wants to do something in you and through you.  He wants to use you for His purpose, but you have to submit to Him.  You have to trust Him.\n\nHis will for you may be to be a preacher like John the Baptist or to be a missionary like Paul, or His will may be for you to be a faithful church member who is active in the ministry of the church and is a faithful witness to your friends and family.  But God wants to do something with your life.  You can write that down.  You have to submit to Him and live for Him.\n\nGreat lives aren’t common.  Most people, even most church members, aren’t living lives submitted to God’s will.  Most people are doing their own thing.  They want God to be their co-pilot.  He wants the steering wheel.  \n\nSo do you want to be great in God’s eyes?  You have to submit to His will.  If He’s leading you, you need to follow.  You need to trust Him.  You need to obey.\n\nThe second thing I think we can learn from the life of John about what it means to be great in God’s eyes is...\n\n## 2. If you want to be great in the eyes of God, be different.\n\nJohn was a living curiosity. He was straight up weird.  Where he lived was weird.  What he ate was weird.  How he dressed was weird. How he talked was weird.  His entire personality seemed strange to the world.  That’s why people went to hear him, because he was different.\n\nIf you want to be great in God’s eyes, then you are going to have to be willing to be different.  You are going to have to be willing to be a little bit weird; a little bit peculiar.\n\nThe Bible says that Christians are supposed to be *”a peculiar people.”* We are supposed to be salt and light while the world around us is decay and darkness.  We are supposed to stand out!  \n\nOne of my favorite quotes is, \n\n> If you want to make a difference you have to be different.  Nothing is made better by adding more of the same.\n\nWe have too much normal.  We have too much average.  Normal is being $10,000 in debt.  Normal is being overweight and obese.  Normal is walking around like a lemming with your brain controlled by an iPhone, tweeting pictures of your lunch.  \n\nNormal is never reading your Bible.  Normal is attending church sporadically.  Normal is never sharing your faith.  Normal is being critical and having a “What’s in it for me?” attitude.  \n\nNormal is pathetic!  \n\nThis world desperately needs some people who will be John the Baptists, who will be peculiar people and who will rise above normal and stand out!\n\nListen, it doesn’t take much to stand out:  \n* Make a decision that you’re going to be in church every Sunday as a priority, and you will stand out.  \n* Make a decision that your kids will dress modestly and that you won’t watch filth, and you’ll stand out.  \n* Make a decision that you won’t cuss and tell dirty jokes with the guys at lunch, and you’ll stand out.  \n* Make a decision that you are going to be faithful to your wife or your husband, and you’ll stand out.\n\nWe aren’t talking about wearing a burlap sack on your head and putting on a sandwich sign here. We are just talking about basic, baseline, holy Christian living.  If you do it, you are going to be different, and you might make a difference.\n\nBe great like John the Baptist and live in the will of God.  Be great like John the Baptist and be willing to be different.  \n\nA third way John was great was...\n\n## 3. If you want to be great in the eyes of God, live a life of humility.\n\nTruly great Christians aren’t great; they are little.  They are humble.  They don’t draw attention to themselves.  They don’t try to be on the top of everything.  They aren’t after the recognition.  They just follow Jesus’ example and they serve.\n\nMatthew 23:12 says:\n\n> *”And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.”*\n\nJesus said in Matthew 20:26, **that he who would be greatest among you would be your minister. He would be your servant.**\n\nIf you want to be great in the world’s eyes, ride the ego train.  Put your name on as much as you possibly can.  But if you want to be great in God’s eyes, take yourself out of the picture and just walk with Jesus.\n\nLive in the will of God. Be willing to be different. Live humbly, and one more thing we can learn about what it means to be great from John the Baptist...\n\n## 4. If you want to be great in the eyes of God, point people to Jesus.\nJohn the Baptist preached a lot of things, but the greatest message he ever preached was what he said when he first saw Jesus:\n\n> *”Behold the lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.”* (John 1:29)\n\nJohn was a living arrow sign pointing people to Jesus.  John didn’t have the answers, but he knew where to send people to find them.\n\nListen: If you want to be great in God’s eyes, there is no greater work here on this earth than the work of pointing people to Jesus.  You and I can’t do much to help people. We can’t change people; we can’t wash their sins away; we can’t give them an eternal home in heaven, but Jesus can.\n\nJesus’ last command was to go and make disciples, to be witnesses, and to share the gospel with people all around the world.  If you want to be great in God’s eyes, do everything you can to be a part of His work on this earth. God’s work on this earth is saving sinners.  \n\nLive in the will of God - Are you doing it?\nLive differently - Are you standing out?\nLive humbly - Are you?\nPoint people to Jesus.\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.\n\n\n",

    "body": "We are going to look at Ecclesiastes 3:1-15 tonight.  It’s one of the best known parts of the book of Ecclesiastes.  If you are a child of the 60s you probably remember the song “Turn, Turn, Turn” by the Birds which takes this chapter word for word and puts it to music.\n\nLet’s read it.\n\n> *”To every [thing there is] a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: 2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which is] planted; 3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; 7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 8 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. 9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 10 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it. 11 He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end. 12 I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God. 14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him. 15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.”*\n\nI don’t think the birds understood what they were singing.  This whole chapter is about time.  And it makes some very important points about time.\n\nBefore we get into it, let me give you some quotes I found on time:\n\n> If you love life, don't waste time, for time is what life is made up of.\n\n> Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. - Warren Buffet\n\n> Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift. That's why it's called the present.\n\n> Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.  (You’ll get that in a minute.)\n\nActually, if you look for quotes on time you’ll find thousands and thousands of them. If you go to the bookstore there are whole sections of books on Time Management.  I’ve probably read a dozen books on time management, I’ve read two books on time management for Pastors this year.  Think about that - if there are two books on time management written by and for pastors, there are a lot of books on time management.\n\nThis passage from \n\n## 1. There are preset seasons of life. (1)\n\nA wise person takes full advantage of the season they are in.  You don’t plant during the harvest and don’t harvest during the spring.  \n\nPersonal recollection: The most wasted time is young adulthood.  Don’t waste your adolescence and your twenties doing nothing.  Invest it in your future.\n\n## 2. We are all heading towards a time of death, and we should live with that in view. (2)\n\nExamples: Steve Jobs, Randy Pausch (The Last Lecture)\n\n## 3. You can’t stop the clock. (2-8)\nStory: boy with the string.\n\n\n\n## 4. You cannot escape the bad times. (2-8)\n\nNo amount of money or prestige is going to keep you from experiencing the bad times in your life.  No matter how good the good times, the bad times are coming.\n\n## 5. You should enjoy the good times as gifts from God (2-8, 13)\n\n\n\n\n## 6. Even our greatest difficulties are in God’s hand and He will make them beautiful (10-11) \n\n\n\n\n## 7.God’s timing is perfect. (11a)\n\n\n\n\n## 8. God makes us yearn for something beyond time. (11b)\n\n\n\n## 9. If we want our time to last, we should be focused on God’s will. (14) \n\n\n\n## 10. God is going to judge us for our use of time. (15b)",

    "body": "I'm going to take a break from Acts just for this morning. To be honest, I studied the passage we came to all week. I read a bunch of commentaries. I listened to other people preach it. I just couldn't come to a clear understanding of what God wanted to teach us in it so I'm calling a last-minute audible and I'm going to preach something else and save that message for next Sunday.\n\nI want to preach a short message this morning from a Proverb I've preached on before. It was a proverb that they hammered into us in Bible college and it's something that I think about all the time.\n\nWe are about to get really, really busy around the church.\n\nWe are hustling to get our church fellowship hall back open.\nWe are going to be starting up our co-op again.\nWe are going to be having fall revival and the family picnic.\nWe are going to be starting up master clubs again.\nWe are going to begin working on our Christmas cantata soon\nWe are going to be resuming the outreach efforts we started.\nIn other words, we are going to have a lot going on. And do you know what? You probably have a lot going on outside of church too. If you have kids at home they are getting back into the schoolyear. You might have fall sports. Hunting season. Harvest. All kinds of stuff.\n\nI have a verse from Proverbs that I think will help us through all of that. Turn with me to Proverbs 14:4.\n\nReally short scripture this morning:\n\n\"Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.\"\n\nThis is one of the strangest verses in the whole Bible. It's really weird. You can't go by context to understand it because there really isn't any. It's a Proverb that stands on it's own.\n\nAnd it doesn't make sense to us. Not on it's face. So you have to know a little bit about history and the culture of the Bible to understand what this verse is saying.\n\nI want to work backwards. Ok. So I'll explain the last part of the verse first. It says:\n\nbut much increase is by the strength of the ox.\n\nThis is a farming verse. If you were a farmer in Bible times, you had it rough. Today they have tractors and all of the implements that go with them. They have giant machines for watering the field and fertilizing. They have multi-disk plows. You can sit in your air conditioned tractor and get most of your work done. Come harvest season you can harvest amazingly well in a combine.\n\n(Brother Harold, did I make it sound like I know anything about farming? Good.)\n\nBut if you lived before about 200 years ago - you didn't have any of that stuff. We were in Cracker Barrell with some old friends Friday and Molly was looking at the farm impliments on the wall and asking me what they do. Most of them were manual.\n\nRegular farmers plowed their fields with hoes. They reaped with a sickle. They planted with their hands. It was backbreaking work and you barely got enough to keep your family fed.\n\nBut what if you had an ox? You could hook up a plow to an ox and the ox would do most of the dirty work. You could hook up a wagon to the ox and it could pull your stuff along side of you. You could hook a rake up to it to pull hay. \nThis might suprise you - but I read a long article that was talking about how oxen are still used today on farms. The article was saying that if you have a small farm, an ox might be better for you than a tractor. It was really interesting. I learned that an oxen is just a cow with a job title. A cow that has been trained to do things around the farm and I learned how amazingly useful a well trained ox is to a small farmer.\n\nAnd do you know that they were farming with oxen in ancient Egypt, using all kinds of impliments, 1,000 years before Proverbs was written. So that's what the last half of this verse is saying, it's saying, if you want to have a farm and get some real work done, you've got to get an ox.\n\nOk, now let's look at the first half. The first half says:\n\n\"Where no oxen are the crib is clean.\"\n\nOk. What does that mean?\n\nThis is where it gets a little scatological. A little gross.\n\nThe crib is the place in the barn where the oxen live. Today we'd call it a stall. And when you have an ox - suddenly you have problems. You have to feed the ox. You have to keep hay through the winter. And wort of all - you have to clean it's stall.\n\nSo if you want to have a successful farm - you have to have an ox. But if you get an ox, you have to clean it's droppings.\n\nSo what does this mean? Is this just a verse for farmers? Can we just cut this verse out of the Bible because it doesn't apply to us?\n\nNo! This verse teaches us a very powerful principle. One that applies whether you are a farmer or a coder. Whether you are a lawyer or a housewife. Whether you are a nurse or a student. No matter what God has you doing with your life - you can learn from this verse and it applies to the church too.\n\nSo what's the principle? Matthew Henry - the preacher from the 1700s, put it this way:\n\nThere can be no advantage without something which, though of little moment, will affright the indolent --Matthew Henry\n\nEllicot said it this way:\n\n...labour has its disagreeable aspect, but also brings its reward, whether material prosperity (“much increase”) or a more enduring reward.\n\nBarnes said it this way:\n\n\" Labor has its rough, unpleasant side, yet it ends in profit. \"\n\nHere's how I'm going to put it: If you want to do something worth doing - it's going to make a mess and it's going to have unpleasant or difficult parts. But if you deal with the difficulty and the mess, you have to possibility of doing something worth doing.\n\nCan I just sort of talk at you for a little bit? Do you know what I'm sick of? Do nothing people. Our society is eat up with do nothing people. We've got a generation of people that expect to be able to make a living and play video games for 6 hours a day. We've got people that want to stay in their pajamas until 4 in the afternoon. We've got a whole host of people who are little snowflakes who never want to be outside of their comfort zone. They just want to stay in their air conditioned comfort and read their entertainment magazines and eat their fast food. They expect the best things in life to be just given to them without them ever having to really work at them.\n\nIt's a cancer. It's a cancer on society.\n\nDo something! Find something worth fighting for. Worth working for. And do it. Swim against the current a little bit.\n\nYou can break a sweat. It doesn't hurt. You can wake up early. You can stay up late. You can spend yourself at something worthwhile.\n\nWhen I was a schoolteacher I used to read my students this book about a real life sailor named Nathaniel Bowditch. Nathaniel Bowditch had a motto. The motto was \"Sail by ash breeze.\" In other words, when the wind isn't blowing and filling your sails, take out your oars (they were made of ash wood) and make your own wind.\n\nOur society needs more people who are willing to sail by ash breeze.\n\nKids. Teenagers. You find out what God wants you to do in this life and you give everything you have on it. If God wants you to be a lawyer - you be the best lawyer you can possibly be for the glory of God. If God wants you to work a job - you work hard at constantly getting better. You take the talents that God has given you and you give God back what He gave with interest.\n\nDon't just float with the current. Any dead fish can do that. You swim against the stream.\n\nIf you are going to do something worth doing there are going to be parts of it - like cleaning up the ox stall - that totally stink. Do it anyways.\n\nNow, let me try to give you some kind of an outline so I don't just rant for the next 15 minutes. I've got four points. Each applies to our personal lives as well as to church so I'll make application in each area.\n\nThe first point is:\n\n1. If it's worth doing, it's going to bring a mess.\nIf you have oxen - you are going to have oxen dung in the barn. You can't have one without the other. They go together. They are two sides of the same coin.\n\nSo it is in life - if it's worth doing - it's often going to make a mess.\n\nIf you want a living example of that go to the fellowship hall right now. Talk about a mess. We've got paint dust covering the floor. Chairs and tables moved all over the place. We have one of our sunday school classes meeting in the nursery. The nursery!\n\nIt looks better now than it did at the beginning. We had ceiling tiles everywhere. Piles of metal. It was a mess.\n\nBut do you know what - there is no way to get that fellowship hall looking nice than by making a mess.\n\nSome of you hate this. You just want everything left the way it is. The way it's always been. If anything changes at all you pitch a fit. You get your whine on.\n\nIf you want to have an ox, if you want to have progress, you are going to have a mess.\n\nWe like things just so. Nice and neat and tidy. Put in nice little rows in the middle of our comfort zone - but nothing happens without messing that up.\n\nWe talk about wanting to see people saved and join the church. Do you know that when that happens - it always brings a mess. People bring their problems with them. They bring their past. They bring their scars and their tattoos and their culture and their bad habits.\n\nIt's just like when a new baby is born. So much potential. So many diapers.\n\nSome of you would never say this - but you don't want to change spiritual diapers. You just want to leave things the way they are.\n\nLet me move on to the second point...\n\n2. If it's worth doing, it's probably going to bring difficulty.\nLook. Oxen need to be fed. They need to be trained. You have to yoke them up with another oxen for years before they are really useful. They bring with them a host of difficulty.\n\nAnd so does anything else worth doing. It comes with difficulty.\n\nWant to plant a garden - you are going to have to pull the weeds. Want a clean orderly house - you have to do the dishes and run the vaccuum. Want to raise godly kids - you are going to have to throw your heart and your time into that. It's going to take putting your hobbies on hold for awhile. Want to start a business - you are going to have to wade through all kinds of problems. Want to be a doctor - you are going to have to clean the crib of years of homework and study and discipline.\n\nIn the church - if we want to start a new ministry their is going to be difficulty.\n\nWhatever it is, if it's worht doing, it's going to have some degree of difficulty.\n\nThomas Edison said\n\n\"Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.\" - Edison\n\nYou have the opportunity to do amazing things for God, but it's going to involve rolling up your sleeves and getting out of your comfort zone.\n\nA guy named Alex Harris said this:\n\n“Great faith is the product of great fights. Great testimonies are the outcome of great tests. Great triumphs can only come out of great trials.” --Alex Harris\n\nIf it's worth doing, it's going to have messes and it's going to have difficulty.\n\nSo the third point is:\n\n3. If we run from the mess and the difficulty, we won't accomplish much.\nThe ancient farmer could have said \"I don't like shoveling ox poop so I'm not going to have an ox.\"\n\nO.k. That's fine. But you aren't going to have much of a farm either.\n\nThat's what most people do. They run from difficulty and because they run from difficulty they never see much in the way of results.\n\nIf you are out on the prairie with a herd of cows on one side of you and a herd of buffalo on the other, and it starts to storm, you'll notice something interesting. When it starts to storm - cows always run away from the storm. It's hard wired into them. But when it starts to storm near buffalo - they always run toward the storm.\n\nNow, here is what's interesting. Because cows aren't very fast - they never outrun the storm. They end up running with the storm and staying under the storm cloud longer. Buffaloe aren't too fast either, but because they are running toward the storm, the storm is going one way and they are going the other and they spend as little time under the storm as possible.\n\nDon't be a cow. Don't run away from difficulty. Run away from messes. When you run away from stuff and choose the path of least resistance - it always causes a bigger mess later. You never get the great results of the guy who stuck with it.\n\nDon't make excuses.\n\nRemember the parable of the talents. One guy got 5 talents, one guy got 3, one guy got one. Then the master went away and told them to invest it. Well, the guy with 3 and the guy with 5 doubled the masters money - but the guy with one buried it and made excuses. How did that work out for him?\n\nListen church - one day we will stand before God and give account. All those excuses you tell yourself - do you really think God is going to listen to them? Do you think he'll be impressed with them? Or do you think he'll say \"you slothful and wicked servant?\"\n\nDo you want to be able to give Him what He deserves - or do you want to give Him excuses?\n\nOne more point and I'll close:\n\n4. If we accept the difficulty and the mess, and push through them, we can accomplish much.\nIf you were a farmer with sense you would say \"Do you know what, I want to be able to farm 30 acres instead of just 2, I don't want to break my back, so that's worth cleaning out a stall every now and then.\"\n\nEmbrace the difficulty. Embrace the mess. Deal with it. Keep trying and much increase will come.\n\nI remember in the 90's, I had an uncle that was into bodybuilding and he used to wear a t-shirt all the time that said \"no pain, no gain.\" That's a principle of life. That's what this verse is teaching us. If you want the gain - you have to deal with the pain.\n\nI think of my generation. So many young people just expect to have all that their parents had and they don't stop to think about all of the sacrifices their parents made to afford that house or to go on that vacation. If you want to succeed in what God has called you to do - it's going to take some serious rolling up the sleeves and just dealing with it.\n\nNow, listen church, this message isn't very \"spiritual.\" At least not in one sense. It's a practical message that could be applied to anybody - whether they are Christians or not.\n\nBut it's a Bible message. Honestly - it's the message some of you need to hear. Some of you would see so many of the problems you are dealing with melt away if you just determined you were going to keep the ox and clean the crib in your personal life. Some of you need to work harder. To save more. To get out of your comfort zone. God has great things for your life - don't settle for the easy things.\n\nSome of you need to determine that you are going to start serving the Lord more. I'll be honest - there are people in our church who never do any kind of service. You have no ministry. You can make whatever excuse you want but it comes down to you don't want to clean the crib. You don't want to sign up to help in Patch clubs because you'd have to give up Thursday evenings. You don't want to join the choir because someone will start missing you if you don't show up on Sunday Evening.\n\nSome of you are going to lose your kids. You'll make every excuse in the book. But God knows you just didn't want to clean the crib. You made excuses. You ran from pain. You'll get pain later on.\n\nThis is a tough message. It's an odd message. But it's a necessary one.\n\nTurn with me to one more passage and we'll close. I want to close on an encouraging note. Turn with me to Galatians 6. Look at verse 9.\n\nThis morning I've been telling you that if you run from difficulty and always try to stay in your comfort zone - you aren't going to do anything worth doing. There is a flip side to that. And that's this. Look at verse 9:\n\nAnd let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. --Galatians 6:9\n\nIf you keep plugging away at what God has given you to do. If you keep cleaning that crib and working that ox. You will reap.\n\nSo what has God been speaking to you about this morning? What is that next step of service or sacrifice that God wants you to take but you've been making excuses?\n\nIs there some change you need to make in your home life?\n\nIs there some habit you've run away from you need to start up?\n\nIs there some place of service you know God is moving you towards that you've been running away from?\n\nKeep the ox and clean the crib.\n\n\"Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.\"\n\nLet me close by saying one more thing. Maybe you are in here and you've never been saved. You've never accepted Christ's free gift of Salvation. It's a free gift for you. But it wasn't a free gift for Him. In order to offer you Salvation He came and lived the perfect life you can't live and took the wrath of God on the cross.",

    "body": "I’ve only run one marathon.  It was a couple of years ago, on a cold and rainy day in Champaign.  I was having so much fun.  I mean, it was really, really rainy, but that rain kept me cool.  There were so many other people running, too, that I didn’t even notice it, and I didn’t feel tired at all until about mile 21.  I remember hitting that twenty mile mark and thinking, “I just ran twenty miles, and I feel great!”  \n\nThen something happened; I hit “the wall.”  My body said, “Enough is enough. What are you doing to me? Are you insane?” And those last five miles were agony.  It got to the point near the end where every step was a challenge.  The crowd thinned out, and there were only a few people running with me in a group.  There weren’t as many cheerers.  A big part of me wanted to stop running so badly.\n\nBut I knew that just a few miles up the road was a stadium with a finish line, and that I’d get to run across the finish line and get a medal that said I’d finished this thing.  I knew there would be hot food there. Most of all, I knew my wife and kids would be there, and they would be so disappointed if I made them come all that way just to quit when times got tough.  So I kept going.\n\nI mention marathons not just because I’m obsessed with running or because I want to brag, I mention marathons because James 1 is all about endurance.  It’s all about enduring trials and temptations, and building patience or endurance.  Several weeks ago, we looked at verses where James said that if you let the trials do their thing and you endure them, you’ll be *”perfect and entire wanting nothing.”*\n\nIn our passage tonight, James is going to pick that theme of endurance up again.  Let’s read verses 12-16.\n\n> *”James 1:12-16 (KJV) 12 Blessed [is] the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. 13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: 14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. 15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 16 Do not err, my beloved brethren.”*\n\nThe next town over from where I grew up has a public high school called “Pinkerton Academy.”   Pinkerton Academy had a really famous teacher many years before I was born named Robert Frost who wrote a poem you may have heard of called *The Road Not Taken.*. You may remember the end of the poem:\n\n> I shall be telling this with a sigh\n> Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—\n> I took the one less traveled by,\n> And that has made all the difference.\n\nThe Christian life is a series of crossroads.  You are constantly coming to a fork in the road and choosing which way you are going to go. \n\n* Are you going to go God’s way or are you going to go man’s way?\n* Are you going to take the path of righteousness or are you going to take the path of sin?\n* Are you going to choose to endure hardship or are you going to seek after ease?\n* Are you going to continue or are you going to quit?\n\nThe first several verses of James 1 teach us that every trial that you face in the Christian life, every hardship, could lead to Christian maturity.  They could make you a complete Christian. Here it says, *”Blessed is the man.”* They could lead to a blessed life. Ultimately, they could lead to a crown of victory, but these verses teach us that those same trials, if we fail them, could also be the point of defeat. They could be the beginning of sin. They could be the death of our Christian walk.\n\nIn other words, every trial and temptation is a crossroads and it really matters which road we take.\n\nSo we have to endure temptation. We have to keep going.  We have to keep following Jesus through the trials instead of letting the trials be the place where we quit and turn back.\n\nSo let’s keep that in mind and look at these verses more carefully.  \n\nThe main thing I think these verses are teaching us is what happens when we keep going through temptation, and what happens when we quit or get distracted through temptation. \n\nSo those are our choices:  Quit or keep going.  Let’s look first at...\n\n# If you keep going...\nVerse 12 says \n\n> *”Blessed is the man who endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.”*\n\nJames is telling us that if we endure temptation, if we go through trials the right way, then God will use those trials in our life and several things will happen.\n\nFirst,\n\n## You’ll end up a complete Christian.\nVerse 4 says:\n\n> *”But let patience have her perfect work”*  (Remember that “patience” is “endurance”) *”that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing.”*\n\nWhen you endure temptations and trials the right way, you build strength and endurance, and you become a stronger Christian. Eventually, you become a complete Christian.  \n\nRemember, God sovereignly ordains our trials.  He’s the coach. They are the workout plan.  Our trials aren’t arbitrary.  God knows what He is doing. He knows what we need to grow stronger and more complete as Christians, and He allows those trials to come into our lives to build us up.  \n\nBut we have to go through the trials.  We have to endure them.  “No pain, no gain.”  If you don’t go through them, you don’t get the benefit.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, I used to read these men’s magazines with all of these workout plans in them.  You know, reading those workout plans didn’t make me a bit stronger. I had to actually do the workouts!  I had to follow through and not quit.  (I didn’t do the workouts by the way.)\n\nSo James is telling us to keep going through trials, and we’ll be stronger, complete, mature Christians.\n\nBut here in verse 12, he tells us more.  He tells us if you keep going...\n\n## You’ll be blessed.\n\nIt says, *”Blessed is the man.”*. \n\nIt’s kind of become a thing today to say, “I’m blessed.”  You can go to just about any store and find throw pillows and wall trinkets that say “blessed” on them.  Hashtag blessed is used over and over on Instagram and Facebook.  But what does it mean to truly be blessed in the Biblical sense?\n\nIt means you have a kind of happiness that isn’t dependent on circumstances.  Happiness comes and goes based on the weather; it’s superficial.  Blessedness is inside of you; it is joy and purpose.  It is the knowledge that God is filling your life with what verse 17 calls *”every good and perfect gift.”*\n\nThe Christian life is hard.  It’s supposed to be.  You are going to endure trials, but it’s also blessed.\n\nIn our Christian high school, we had to memorize this poem that I later learned comes from a hymn:\n\n---\n\nGod hath not promised skies always blue,\nFlower-strewn pathways all our lives through;\nGod hath not promised sun without rain,\nJoy without sorrow, peace without pain.\n\nGod hath not promised we shall not know\nToil and temptation, trouble and woe;\nHe hath not told us we shall not bear\nMany a burden, many a care.\n\nGod hath not promised smooth roads and wide,\nSwift, easy travel, needing no guide;\nNever a mountain, rocky and steep,\nNever a river, turbid and deep.\n\nBut God hath promised strength for the day,\nRest for the labor, light for the way,\nGrace for the trials, help from above,\nUnfailing sympathy, undying love.\n\n---\nYes, if you walk with Jesus, then you will deal with trials and hardships, but you also get daily strength; you get true rest; you get direction; you get God’s provision.  Your life is truly blessed.  Not hashtag blessed, but God blessed.\n\nSo if you keep going through trials, you’ll be a complete Christian; you’ll be blessed, and look at the third thing...\n\n## You’ll receive the crown of life.\nThe text says, *”For when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.”*\n\nCrowns in the Bible meant a lot of things. They are tied to joy, to royalty, to belonging, but mostly, they are tied to victory.  When an athlete won a contest, they’d get a crown.  I think that’s obviously what it’s talking about here.\n\nLife is like a great marathon, and yes, it gets tough, but at the end of the marathon when you cross that finish line, your Lord and Savior will have a crown of victory to place on your head.  There is a reward coming.  Not only will you be blessed in this life, but you’ll be rewarded in the next.\n\nSo James is encouraging us to keep going.  Endure temptations.  Endure trials.  Endure hardships.  There are rewards coming if we keep going.\n\nBut these verses don’t just tell us what is going to happen if we keep going. They also tell us what will happen...\n\n\n# If you turn back or to the side...\nYou see, there are two kinds of temptations and trials.  Some trials are just hardships, but other trials are temptations to sin. In every trial, whether it’s sickness or financial trials or family issues or just weariness, there is always the temptation to quit—quit trying to serve God, and quit trying to live a righteous life.  \n\nAnd James wants us to know what that will look like, too.  First, he tells us that if you are tempted and you turn aside or turn back...\n\n## You can’t blame God\nVerse 13 says:\n\n> *”Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:”*\n\nThis is tricky.  If you believe in the sovereignty of God; if you believe that God is in control of everything and working it all out for good to them that love Him and are called according to His purpose; if you believe God is using the trials we face to complete us, then can’t we just blame our failures on Him?  Can’t we just say, “God, I wasn’t ready for that temptation. It’s your fault?”\n\nJames says NO!  You can’t blame God for your temptation to sin.  You can’t say God is trying to trip you up.  That’s not in God’s nature.  He’s 100% pure.  He doesn’t have any malice in Him.  He doesn’t derive any enjoyment from watching people fall.  James is saying it’s not even possible for God to think that way.\n\nSo who do we blame?  Who do we blame for our failures?\n\nI’ve heard so many excuses and you have, too:\n\n* I was just too tired.\n* I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n* I wasn’t getting what I needed.\n* The devil made me do it.\n\nJames blows all of that out of the water.  There is only one person we can blame when we sin. It’s not the devil, it’s not God, and it’s not our circumstances.\n\n## You can only blame yourself\n\nVerse 14 says:\n\n> *”But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.”*\n\nDo you know what the source of your sin problem is?  It’s not the devil. It’s not your circumstances.  It’s you.  It’s your heart.\n\nJeremiah 17:9 says, *”The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?”*\n\nYou are the source of your sin problem.  \n\nYou don’t need the devil.  You don’t need external motivation to sin.  You have that inside of you.  You have your own sinful desires that you are fighting all the time.\n\nDon’t try to blame your sin on other people.  Own it.  Realize the source of the problem is in your own heart.  Until you do, you won’t win many battles.\n\nSo James tells us if we turn back, then we can’t blame God. We can only blame ourselves, but he also tells you that if you turn back and sin...\n\n## You will be sowing seeds of failure later on.\n\nHe says: \n\n> *”But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.  Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.”*\n\nJames is picturing lust here as a temptress and the sin as a baby.    Our own desires are like the woman in Proverbs 7 that says “Come, come, come to me.” \n\nThat’s the illustration James is using, but it’s important that we realize that even though James is using that illustration, lust isn’t necessarily sexual.  Lust just means “strong desires.”  Your lust could be to stay in bed in the morning when God has a job for you to do.  Your lust could be to make more money when God wants you to be content with what you have.  Your lust could be to be popular when God wants you to stand out for Him.  Your lust could be to take it easy.  Your lust could be sexual.  \n\nThe point is that you are being flirted with constantly by the desires of your heart, and if you let those desires have their way, there are going to be consequences.  It’s going to bring forth death in your life.\n\n---\n\nNow, before I wrap this up there is one more important thing that these verses teach us we need to cover before we move on.  These verses, as much as any verses in the Bible, teach us about how sin works, and because they teach us how sin works, they teach us how to defeat sin.\n\nSin isn’t God’s fault, it’s not the devil’s fault, and it’s not our circumstances’ fault.  We are all being flirted with by the sinful desires of our own heart.  It’s internal.\n\nIn other words, sin always starts the same way.  **It always starts in your mind and in your heart.**  The way to defeat sin is to defeat it when it is still small, in your mind and in your heart.  Your mind and your heart is the battle ground where we fight against sin.  It’s not our bodies.  It’s not our circumstances.  It’s in our mind.  \n\nBecause sin always starts in the mind and heart, what we have to do is not flirt with sinful desires and not allow those desires to take root.  We can’t allow ourself to think on those sinful desires.  We have to ignore them.\n\nDo you know how you do that?  You do that by staying focused on something else.  You focus on loving God; you focus on God’s blessing; you focus on the reward at the end of the trial, and you won’t have much time for thinking about the flirtations of sin.\n\nNancy Reagan popularized the phrase “just say no,” but it’s not enough to just say “no” to sin, you have to say “yes” to God.  You can’t just **remove** sinful thoughts, you need to **replace** them.\n\nAnother thing this teaches us about defeating sin is this:  If sin starts with desires of your heart, and if we want to defeat sin, we shouldn’t put stuff in our heart and mind that is going to feed those desires.  If you say you want to defeat the sin of lust, then it makes no sense to read 50 Shades of Gray or look at pornography.  If you say you want to get victory over drunkeness, then it makes no sense to read magazines full of Smirnoff ads or watch TV shows placed in adds or listen to songs about “red solo cups” on the radio.  \n\nYou have to starve those desires while they are small and you have to replace them with Godly things.\n\nRemember, if you endure temptations and trials, you’ll receive the crown of victory.  There is a prize coming.\n\nSo keep your eyes on the prize and off of everything else.  Recognize that sin starts with an internal desire and shut those desires down.  Don’t give them the air of any of your attention.  Focus your attention on Jesus.  \n\nThat’s how you defeat sin.  You kill it by starving it of attention when its still really small.\n\n---\n\nSo let’s review here.  James is teaching us that if we keep going and endure temptations, we are going to be complete Christians; we are going to be blessed; we are going to receive rewards in heaven.  But we have this constant temptation to quit, to not endure temptations, and to turn aside. That temptation isn’t God’s fault. We can’t blame it on circumstances. We can only blame it on our own desires, so we have to starve those desires and keep going so we can win the prize.\n\nSo keep going.  When you are at mile 21 of the marathon and you don’t feel like you can run another step, focus on the prize, not on the pain. Don’t even let your mind think about quitting. Think about the finish line.\n\nThere is one more verse I want to cover in closing.  Verse 16 says:\n\n> *”Do not err, my beloved brethren”*\n\nWhatever you do, don’t deceive yourself.  Don’t give yourself excuses.  Keep going.  Get that crown of life.  Be the victor.  Be blessed.  Grow in Christ.  \n\nDon’t make excuses.  Don’t err.  Keep going.\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "# Psalm 78 - Learn from the Past or Repeat It\n\nThe Spanish philosopher George Santayana is the person who is thought to have coined this phrase:\n\n> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. \n\nMark Twain supposedly said:\n\n> History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes.\n\nOne of the stupidest things that people ever say is, “I want to make my own mistakes.”  I think every teenager says this to their parents at some time.  I know I did, but wisdom is learning from the mistakes of others so we don’t have to make them.\n\nThis Psalm is a message to the next generation to learn one very specific lesson from history.  We’ll get to that lesson in a minute, but before we do, let’s just say this:\n\n**If we lose the next generation, all is lost.** The single most important job that we have is passing down the truth of God from generation to generation.  **We had better be dead serious about teaching our children to love God’s word and teaching them to follow our God.** It’s one of the most important jobs that we have.\n\nDeuteronomy 6:7 says:\n\n> *”And thou shalt teach them (and that’s the truths of God) diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.”*\n\n\nThe main message of this Psalm:\n\nNext generation, learn the lesson of the Northern Kingdom.\n\n(The Northern Kingdom in this Psalm is represented by Ephraim; the southern Kingdom is represented by Judah.)\n\n## What the Northern Kingdom did (9-11):\n* They fainted in battle (9)\n* They didn’t keep God’s covenant (10)\n* They forgot all that they had seen God do (11)\n\n## What the Northern Kingdom saw (12-29):\n* God rescue them from Egypt (12)\n* God part the Red Sea (13)\n* God lead them with the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night (14)\n* God give them water out of rocks (15-16)\n* God give them manna out of heaven (23-25)\n* God give them meat when the manna wasn’t enough (26-29)\n\n## What they experienced:\n* God’s salvation \n* God’s provision \n* God’s unbelievable mercy and forgiveness \n* God’s judgment when they pushed too far\n\nThe Contrast Presented:\n* Ephraim is replaced as the leader with Judah (67-72)\n* Jesus would come through the tribe of Judah.",

    "body": "We are going to look at a short passage of scripture tonight.  Just a few verses really.  Let's read verses 1-13.\n\n> *\"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium. Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek. And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem. And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily. Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not. And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas. And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us. And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them. Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days. And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women which resorted thither.\"*\n\nThere are two main things that happen in these verses:\n\n* Paul is paired up with one of his main helpers and his protege - Timothy\n* They move their mission into Europe.\n\nHonestly, there isn't a huge amount to go on in these verses.  Many of the commentaries I read didn't have much of anything to say about them.  One guy who I read who usually writes like a book on every chapter in Acts just folds this into another message.  \n\nDespite that - I think there are three lessons we can learn about doing God's work in this passage - they have to do with the personnel of God's work, the priorities of God's work, and the plan of God's work.  \n\nLet's pray and we'll jump in.\n\nThe first lesson I think we can learn here is about\n\n# 1. The **Personnel** of God's Work.\n\nThe very first thing that we see Paul doing here is taking on a new member in their team.  \n\nYou could almost get the impression from the end of chapter 15 - the John Mark episode - that Paul wasn't interested in working with other people.  But that's not true at all.  I think we see that Paul was always bringing people along and getting people to help him in the work God had called him to do.\n\nHere, Paul sees this young Timothy, who at this point may have been as young as 16, and Paul sees this the potential in Timothy and signs him up to be his helper.\n\n---\n\nLet's take a quick look at Timothy.  Hold your finger here and let's look at several scriptures about him:\n\nLet's look first at 2 Timothy 1:5\n\n> *\"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands\"*\n\nOne of the things that stands out about Timothy is that he was a person who had pure faith. \"Unfeigned faith\" as Paul puts it.  Another thing about him is that he knew the scriptures.  \n\nLet's look at another passage. Turn to 1 Cor. 14:17:\n\n> *\"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.\"*\n\nSo he was also someone who Paul considered a son, and he was faithful in the Lord.  \n\nBack in our text we get a few more details about Timothy:\n\n> *\"Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.\"*\n\nSo...  \n\n* Even though He's a young person - he has a sterling reputation among the Christians in the area. \n* His father is a Greek - So Timothy is half jewish.\n\nLater on in Timothy's life he would be Paul's most trusted lieutenant and ultimately he ended up serving as the pastor of the church in Ephesus.\n\nWe also learn from the book of Timothy that Timothy was a little bit fearful, was probably self-conscious about how young he was, and had some minor health problems.\n\nSo that's Timothy. \n\n---\n\nNow, what does this teach us about the Personnel of God's work?\n\nTwo things I think we can learn:\n\nThe first is...\n\n## A. It takes a team.\n\nPaul realized that God's work was way to big for him to do by himself, he was going to have to have some help.  He was going to have to build a team.\n\nThat team included himself, Silas, Timothy, Titus, Luke and a bunch of other people: Aquilla and Priscella, Demas, Artemas, Tychicus, Appolos, Zenas and more.\n\nJohn C. Maxwell - the pastor/leadership guru is famous for saying:\n\n> \"Teamwork makes the dream work, but a vision becomes a nightmare when the leader has a big dream and a bad team.\n\nPaul gets all of the credit.  He's the name attached to it.  But Paul was just the leader - he had a great team of people behind him helping him.  They were all striving together towards the work God had called them to do.\n\nSometimes we think about famous people and their accomplishments all wrong.  Steve Jobs didn't create the iPhone - Steve Jobs led a team of hundreds of people who gave us the iPhone.  LeBron James didn't win the championship this year - LeBron James and a team did.  Thomas Jefferson didn't give us the declaration of independence, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Roger Sherman and Richard Henry Lee co-wrote it, and then the continental congress heavily edited it.\n\nLook, if our church is going to go anywhere - if we are going to accomplish any of our dreams, it's going to take teamwork.  If we are limited to what I can do or what someone else can do - we won't do much.\n\nAnd another thing - it really takes a team that cares more about sharing the work than sharing the glory.  Harry Truman is quoted as saying:\n\n> It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit.\n\nGod's work should be done for God's glory.  He deserves the praise and the credit.  Whenever you get to thinking - \"I do more around here than so and so.\" You are on shaky ground.\n\nThis brings up the second lesson about the personnel of God's work.  Where does the team come from?  Where did Paul get Timothies and Tituses and Lukes?\n\nThe second lesson is:\n\n## B. It takes training.\n\nHold your finger here again and turn to 2 Timothy 2:2\n\n> *\"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.\"*\n\nTimothy didn't start his journey with Paul a leader who was ready to take over the church at Ephesus - he had to learn a lot first, and he learned it on the job at the side of Paul.\n\nEphesians 4:11-12 says:\n\n> *\"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:\"*\n\nA lot of people think that it is the job of the pastors and the \"Full time Christian workers\" to do the work of the ministry - but that's not the case.  Our job is to perfect the saints so that you can do the work of the ministry.  Our job is primarily training.\n\nWhen you go to the Doctor, you probably appreciate the fact that they spend so much time in training.  Years and years of med-school plus residencies plus lots of ongoing training.  You understand that that is so important.\n\nWhen you think of great preachers from the 1800s there are two names that always come to people's minds: Charles Spurgeon in London and D.L. Moody in America.  Do you know that probably the biggest legacy that either of those men left was not the books they wrote or the sermons they preached - it was the people they trained to do the work of the ministry.\n\nThat makes a lot of sense.  But think about this - the greatest preacher who ever lived was Jesus and the PRIMARY thing that Jesus did on this earth wasn't miracles or even preaching, it was training.\n\nListen folks, time spent sharpening the axe isn't wasted time.  A call to do anything for God is a call to prepare and a call to be constantly learning.\n\nSo that's what this passage teaches us about the personnel of the Lord's work, the second thing I want you to see is:\n\n# 2. The priority of the Lord's work. \n\nLook again at verse 3:\n\n> *\"Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek\"*\n\nThere are two amazing things that this verse teaches us that are really easy to miss:\n\nFirst, did you catch the phrase at the beginning *\"Him would Paul have to go forth with him\"*?  Remember how old Timothy is?  At the oldest, he's 25 years old here.  More likely he's still a teenager.  A teenager.\n\nWhat makes it even more interesting is that this passage seems to teach that Timothy's dad was either dead or out of the picture.  So here you have Timothy and he's just a teenager and he's about to leave his mother and grandmother and go out where?  We don't know.  Paul doesn't even know.\n\nRemember - no email.  No facetime.  No cell phones.  Not even phone books. \n\nThis teaches us an important lesson:\n\n## God's call should take priority over family ties.\n\nNow, let me be clear what I'm not saying. I'm not saying that being a Christian who feels like God is calling you to his work means you can ignore or mistreat your family.  I'm not saying that it's ok for a dad who is a pastor to be a bad dad for the Lord's sake.  \n\nWhat I am saying is that sometimes God calls us to leave our families.\n\nI can talk a little bit about this: I don't talk about this often, but the hardest part of being a pastor for me is being very far away from my family.  I have a very close family - not just my brothers and nieces and nephews.  But aunts and uncles and cousins and living grandparents.  It's tough.  When we go for a trip home and it's time to leave I want to blaze out of there not because I'm ready to go but because it's really tough to leave.\n\nBut, I believe I followed God here and that takes priority.\n\nYou've all heard of Hudson Taylor.  Do you know that Hudson Taylor went on a trip through the US to get missionaries and he told people at every stop and every church: I don't want your money - I want your sons and daughters.  I want you to meet me at such and such a place in California at such and such a time and when you meet me there - pack everything you have in a coffin, because you are likely never coming home.\n\nThat's tough.  But sometimes that's what it costs to follow God and do His work.\n\nThe second thing we see in this about the priority of the Lord's work is:\n\n## God's call should take priority over pride.\n\nBack in verse 3 notice that it says: \n\n> *and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters*\n\nWait a second?!  Hold the phone!  What?\n\nRemember last Sunday? (Don't worry - I barely do.)  Paul just got finished at the Jerusalem counsil where he was passionately arguing against asking new Christians to get circumcised.  Yet here, the first thing Paul has Timothy do is get circumcised.\n\nI'm not going into the details but this isn't a small ask.  This is a big deal.\n\nSo why did Paul do it?  It wasn't about salvation - Timothy was obviously saved already?  It was about ministry.  \n\nLet me ask you something - would there be anything wrong with Timothy not getting circumcised?  No.  Not a thing.  Paul established that in chapter 15 and in many places in his writings.  So why have Timothy circumcised?\n\nThe answer is simple - because it would help Timothy in his ministry.  He did it for others.\n\nTurn with me to 1 Corinthians 9 and let's look at verses 19-23:\n\n> *\"For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.\"*\n\nI hear folks sometimes and they say things like \"Where in the Bible does it say that I have to ...\" and \"There is nothing wrong with...\"  and do you know what? A lot of the times, they are right.  They are right.  Absolutely.\n\nBut do you know, even if they are right, we aren't called to live on the plane of right and wrong  - that's the law.  We are called to live on the plane of grace.  We live by the law of grace and that is a much higher standard.\n\nSometimes grace says \"I know there is absolutely nothing wrong with this - but I'm going to abstain from it anyways because I want to be able to win these people.\"\n\nHere's the main point though - it's not about us being right, it's not about pride.  Timothy didn't come under the knife out of pride - he did it out of love.  Take a look at your standards that other people might question - do you do it out of pride?  Is it something you do so you can pat yourself on the back and say \"I'm glad I'm not like so and so.\"  You very well may be doing the right thing - but you are doing it for the wrong reason.\n\nLet me quickly move on to...\n\n# 3. The **plan** of God's Work:\n\nBack in our text, the Apostle Paul get's Timothy and begins to go around Asia Minor - modern day Turkey - visiting churches.  That's the plan.  But that's not what happens.\n\nGod keeps shutting doors.  God won't let them have peace about it.  Look at verses 6-7:\n\n> *\"Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia, After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.\"*\n\nThen verse 9 says:\n\n> *\"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.\"*\n\nHere is the lesson:\n\n## God's work requires the leadership of God's Spirit",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me and turn to Galatians 5.  Galatians 5.  I’m going to be preaching verses 13-16 this morning.\n\nNow, I’m kind of skipping over verses 7-12.  I’m not going to preach a whole message on those verses.  In verses 7-12 Paul is dealing with these legalistic judiazers and it’s really a continuation of what the entire book of Galatians has been.  So look over those verses in your own time and we are going to move on to verses 13-16 this morning.  \n\nLet’s read those verses:\n\n> *13 For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only [use] not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. 14 For all the law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. 16 [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.*\n\nMost of us probably consume a ton of “How To” content.  We read books and magazines about how to cook, or how to do woodworking, or how to fix up the car. We read books about how to be better in business or better at marketing or better at parenting.  We watch how-to shows on TV or how to videos on YouTube.  We like it when its just plain and clear and we have easy instructions to follow.\n\nIn this whole book of Galatians, it’s been about an idea:  The idea of Grace.  The idea that we aren’t saved because of our works but because of Christ’s work on the cross.  The idea that we aren’t a slave to religion or to the law anymore.  \n\nBut there hasn’t been a lot of “how to” kind of content in the book of Galatians.  It’s mostly been doctrinal.  But that is going to change starting today - because the rest of the book of Galatians is very, very practical.  It tells us how to put this great truth of God’s grace into practice in our lives.\n\nI’m going to give you four points this morning from these couple of verses that tell us how God wants us to live the Christian life.\n\nLet’s jump right into it:\n\nLook at verse 13 again:\n\n> *”For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty”*\n\nThe first thing we see in this passage is…\n\n## 1. We have all been called to the free life.\n\nWe have been called to liberty.  To freedom.  God wants every Christian to live a life that is characterized by freedom.\n\nNow, how are we free?  A bunch of ways, first… \n\n##### We are free from sin\n\nJesus said in John 8:34 that those who commit sin are a slave to sin.  Think about that - a slave to sin.\n\nSin has this way of enslaving us doesn’t it.  It starts off innocent enough, it starts off as a thrill, but before long we can hardly help ourselves and we can’t push back and it’s running our lives.   \n\nThere are people all around us enslaved to lust and pornography, or enlsaved to drunkenness, or enlsaved to anger or enslaved to their ego.  They almost can’t even fight against it anymore.\n\nAnd what hope do they have?  What hope do we have?  It’s only in Jesus.\n\nJesus said one of the things he came here to do is *”to preach deliverance to the captives”*, He said *“Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”*\n\nWhen you trust Christ as your savior, you become a new creature, you get a new nature and you don’t have to be overpowered by sin anymore.  You are free from it.\n\nTurn with me to Romans 6 for a minute.  Romans 6.  We are going to read verses 11-14.\n\n> *”[Rom 6:11-14 KJV] 11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. 12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. 13 Neither yield ye your members [as] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members [as] instruments of righteousness unto God. 14 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.”*\n\nIf you are saved this morning, you are dead to sin.  It might not “feel” like you are dead to sin, but you need to reckon that you are.  You now have the power to have victory over sin.\n\nDr. Flanders gave the best illustration of this I’ve ever heard this year.  He said it’s like you work for a restaurant and you have a terrible boss who mistreats you and yells at you and works you too hard and doesn’t pay you. Then you get a job at a different restaurant and your boss is wonderful.  But say you go back to the old restaurant, just with your friends to get a hamburger or something and your old boss gets in your face and says “you - mop the floor.”  What are you going to say?  “I don’t work for you anymore.”\n\nListen, when the old boss of sin rears it’s ugly head in your life you say “I don’t work for you anymore.  My contract has been bought out by the blood of Jesus Christ.  I don’t have to listen to and obey you anymore.  \n\nWe are free from sin.\n\nDo you know what else we are free from as believers?…\n\n##### We are free from guilt\n\nAs a believer in Christ - you have Christ’s righteousness.  You have a spotless, white as snow record in the eyes of God.  \n\nRomans 8 asks the question *”Who can lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?”* And the answer is obvious - no one.\n\nI was in Wendy’s the other day and this kid came in with his parents and he had a terrible t-shirt on.  The t-shirt said “Only God can judge me.”\n\nYou know - I don’t like the sentiment of that t-shirt.  Because God has already judged a lot of human behavior and He has already said it’s bad.  But there is a truth to it.  In the grand scheme of things the only person who can condemn you is God.\n\nAnd do you know what?  God took on human flesh and came down from His courtroom in heaven and paid your penalty for you on the cross.   \n\nIt’s like you are running in a race and you stumble and get out of your lane on the track. You just know you are going to be disqualified and you are just waiting to hear the whistle. But instead the referee comes and picks you up and runs the rest of the race with you.  \n\nYou can be free from guilt because your guilt was carried by Jesus on the cross.  I don’t care what you have done - Jesus Grace is bigger and His death took care of it.  \n\nListen, that means…\n\n##### We are free from Hell\n\nIf you have put your faith and trust in Christ and what He has done - you don’t have to fear the judgement of God in Hell.  You aren’t going to the lake of Fire.  Jesus took your punishment and you are wearing His righteousness.\n\nImagine being in death row for a moment.  Knowing that at any moment - the executioner was going to come and judge you and take away your life…and then in comes an official and says “no - his crime has been paid for and he has a spotless record.”  That’s what we have in Jesus Christ.  \n\nWe are free from sin, we are free from guilt, we are free from Hell and lastly…\n\n##### We are free from the law (as a motivator)\n\nThe first verse in this chapter tells us that we should *“Stand fast in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again in the yoke of bondage.”*\n\nI’ve preached to you a bunch about how this means we aren’t under the law anymore.  In fact, Paul goes so far as to say if you are trusting the law then Jesus does you no good.\n\nWe are free from the law.  We are not to live legalistic, letter of the law kind of lives.  We don’t live the Christian life tiptoeing around the law of God, afraid we are going to break one of His commandments and end up in Hell.  We aren’t going to be judged by the law.  That Guillotine is never going to drop.  So we don’t have to live by the letter of the law as the jews did, we live by the spirit of the law.\n\nWe don’t live in fear of the law of God.  We don’t live in fear of the “thou shalt nots” - that’s not our motivator for following God’s way anymore.\n\nSo we are free.  Now.  Before I go any further…are you free?  Have you trusted Christ as your savior?   \n\nCan you sing “Thank God I am free, free free from this world of sin, been washed in the blood of Jesus, I’ve been born again.  Hallelujah I’m saved, saved saved by his wonderful Grace.  I’m so glad that I found out, He would take me out and show me the way.”\n\nSo listen, if you are a Christian this morning, you have been called to live free.  People out to be able to see that freedom in your life.  You aren’t a slave anymore.  You aren’t shackled anymore.  You are free.\n\n---\n\nBut what does that mean?  Does that mean because we are free from the law we can do whatever we want?  Do we take this liberty and make it mean that we have liberty to go out and get drunk, or liberty to fill our minds with pornography, or liberty to do whatever we want?\n\nA lot of Christians are afraid of this idea of Christian liberty because they think it means “do whatever you want” and to be honest, there are many, many Christians who **abuse** this idea of liberty to do whatever they want.  But that isn’t what Paul is talking about here.\n\nYou see, not only does this passage teach us that the every Christian is called to the free life, it also teaches us that…\n\n## 2. The free life is not the flesh life.\n\nAgain, verse 13 says:\n\n> *”For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh,”*\n\nWe have this awesome freedom.  Freedom from sin, from guilt, from Hell and from the letter of the law.  And we *could* take that freedom and spin it and use it to do whatever we want but we can’t do that.  \n\nWe are commanded here not to use our freedom to live fleshly lives.\n\nThe word “flesh” here, it doesn’t mean skin.  It doesn’t refer to our body.  It refers to our inclination to sin.  To live sinful lives.  To live for us.\n\nEvery one of us wants what we want.  We have this innate desire to be selfish and to put our wants over everyone else.  We have this desire to eat what we want to eat and drink what we want to drink and sleep when we want to sleep and wake up when we want to wake up.\n\nThat’s the flesh.  This selfish, sinful desire that is inside of us. You may not be a drunkard, but you’ve probably felt pulled in that direction.  You may not be an adulterer, but you’ve probably been pulled in that direction.  You may not lie all the time, but you have that inclination.  All of us fight lust and anger and bitterness and cruelty.  That’s the flesh.\n\n> *”only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh,”*\n\nThat word “Occasion” is a military word.  It’s a word that means “Base of operations.”\n\nNow we have this freedom - but if we take that freedom and use it as an excuse to live as a slave to our sinful inclinations.  We are abusing that freedom.  Our freedom shouldn’t be a base for our flesh.\n\nSo we have to understand that the free life is not the flesh life.  A third thing we see in these verses is…\n\n## 3. The free life is the love life.\n\nLook at the verses again…\n\n> *”For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.”*\n\nDo you know how we are to live the free life?  We aren’t to use it selfishly in our flesh but we are to use it in love and in service to others.\n\nReally - that is the *spirit* of the law.  That’s what verse 14 is telling us.  God’s heart with his commandments isn’t to put us in a restrictive box.  God wants us to be free.  But God also wants us to not hurt each other and to not be shackled to selfishness or to be a stumbling block for other people.\n\nListen, let me give you some examples of this in action ok?  \n\nGod wants us to dress modestly.  That’s a New Testament principle.  But do you know, we don’t dress modestly because God wants to put us in a box.  We don’t dress modestly because God is trying to restrict us.  We dress modestly because we don’t want to be a stumbling block to our brothers.  \n\nIf we are showing off our bodies we might be a stumbling block to a brother or sister in Christ.  If we are showing off our wealth with our fancy clothes we might hurt one of our brothers and sisters who could never afford to dress that way.  If we are trying to be super hip we might encourage one of our impressionable young teenagers to be really worldly.  That’s why we dress modestly.  The motivation isn’t some “letter of the law” legalism. We’ve been set free from that.  The motivation is love for our brothers and sisters in Christ.\n\nThe New Testament says we are to *“forsake not the assembling of ourselves together.”*. In other words, God wants us to be faithful in our church attendance.  We don’t go to church out of some legalistic fear that we are going to make God mad and he isn’t going to be happy with us.  We go to church out of love.  We do it because we love God and we do it because it gives us an opportunity to love each other and encourage each other.\n\nAnd we could go through almost every command in the New Testament and say the same thing.  They aren’t given to put us in a box.  They are given to guide us so we don’t hurt each other and so that we can live in love.\n\nAnd listen, if you ever find yourself “biting and devouring one another” as this passage says - that’s a good sign that you are in bondage to some kind of selfishness and pride.  The Bible says *“only by pride cometh contention.”*\n\n\nSo we are to live the free life and that isn’t a life of flesh it’s a life of love.  There is one more piece of this.  One more point…\n\n## 4. The free life is the spirit led life.\n\nVerse 16 says *”This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.”*\n\nI’m not going to fully develop this point, because we are going to look at this a lot next week.  But here is what this is saying:\n\nWhen you trusted Christ, you were given the Holy Spirit.  He lives inside of you.  He indwells you.  He is the one who sets you free from sin and gives you a desire to serve God.  And the Holy Spirit wants to lead you.\n\nNow how does the Holy Spirit speak to you?  I think the main way the Holy Spirit speaks to you is through the Bible.  After all, the Bible is written by the Holy Spirit.  If you have the Bible in you - the Holy Spirit is going to use it to speak to you on a regular basis.\n\nThe Holy Spirit speaks to us through prayer.  When we pray the Holy Spirit is in on that and speaking to us and leading us.\n\nAnd sometimes, not all the time, but sometimes the Holy Spirit very plainly leads us to do something.  Maybe it’s go down the altar, maybe it’s to witness to someone or to give some special gift.  Maybe it’s to make some big decision.  \n\nBut if you are saved this morning you have the Holy Spirit and He should be leading you and you should be looking for and following His leading.\n\nWe are going to talk about that more next week.\n",

    "body": "We are going to look this morning at one of the most famous passages in the book of Acts. It's known as \"Paul's Farewell Address.\" Let's read it, and I'll set the stage and we'll just hit a couple of the high points this morning.\n\n\"[Act 20:13-38 KJV] 13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot. 14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene. 15 And we sailed thence, and came the next [day] over against Chios; and the next [day] we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next [day] we came to Miletus. 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost. 17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. 18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: 20 [And] how I kept back nothing that was profitable [unto you], but have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to house, 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. 22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: 23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. 24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. 25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am] pure from the blood of all [men]. 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. 28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. 33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. 36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. 37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kissed him, 38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.\"\n\nLet me quickly break this down for you, and then I\"ll get right into the message this morning:\n\nPaul has concluded his second missionary journey. He's on his way back to Jerusalem. He's got an offering for the people there. We talked about that last Sunday. But everywhere Paul goes people are warning him that bad things are going to happen in Jerusalem. Everyone knows this is going to be Paul's last hurrah. Paul knows it.\n\nSo in this passage, he's travelling and he purposely skips Ephesus. Apparently he thought going there would take too much time because it was kind of home and he'd been away for awhile. But he wanted to see the Ephesian pastors one more time so he called them to come and visit him in a nearby town called Miletus. So all these pastors and church leaders come from Ephesus to this little town Miletus to have a kind of Preachers fellowship, and Paul addresses them there. It was kind of like the first preachers retreat.\n\nVerses 13-17 just lay all of that out, from verse 18 through the end of the chapter Paul is giving a sort of last speech, a farewell address to these people. It's really emotional. He knows he won't see them again.\n\nIt's interesting that this is the only time in all of Acts it records one of Paul's sermons to Christians. There are a couple times it tells us what he preached to lost people, but this is the only time he preaches to Christians.\n\nAnd if you look at it closely - it's almost like the cliff notes of all of Paul's letters. Paul of course wrote 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Collossians, Philippians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon. And if you compare what he says here - it's almost like someone took all of those letters and put them on the stove and boiled them down to their theme.\n\nI'm not going to get into all of that. You can read and study that sometime if you want. It would be an interesting study. I want to sort of focus on verse 24:\n\n\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.\"\n\nI think this speech teaches us all lessons about 5 important parts of life: Our purpose, our time, our ministry, and about our comfort I also think there are some valuable lessons about church leadership but I'll probably leave that for next Sunday or for Sunday Night. Again: Our purpose, our time, our ministry, and our comfort.\n\nSo let's pray and I'll make those four points and we'll be done.\n\nThe first thing I think we need to learn from this farewell speech is:\n\n1. What it teaches us about purpose\nPaul said:\n\n\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.\"\n\nI want you to notice that Paul said \"that I might finish MY COURSE\" What is that?\n\nI looked it up and it means \"a race course.\" I know I make everything a running analogy - this is literally a running analogy. Paul is saying, that I might finish the marathon that God has put me in.\n\nWhat's the point? I think the point is that Paul knew God had given him something specific to do. Something with clear markers. Something with a finish line. God didn't say \"Here, Paul, go do your own thing.\" God said, \"here is your course, here is the lines and here are the turns and here is the finish line now go after it.\" And Paul was obsessed with finishing it.\n\nNow, what does that teach us? How can we apply that?\n\nI think it's clear that ...\n\nWe have all been given something to do.\nI have a course. You have a course. Sometimes we call it a call. Sometimes we call it \"the will of God.\" Whatever you call it - you must understand that God wants you to accomplish SOMETHING. God has SOME SPECIFIC job for you.\n\nThink of the parables. The parable of the talents. The master gave his servants a bunch of talents and went away and what came next - a day of reckoning. A day when the master saw what his servants had done with what he had given them.\n\nLook at me folks - there is a day of reckoning coming. Someday, sooner than you think, you are going to stand before God and He's going to expect you to have accomplished something.\n\nNow, I don't know what your course is. That's between you and God. But I know it's something. I know that God has a purpose for you. I know it's something big. I know its something that is going to take effort and struggle.\n\nFew things bother me more than people who seem to be wasting their life. Do you realize that the average person watches 3 hours and 46 minutes of TV a day? That's 9 years of your life you spend in front of the TV? And we wonder why we aren't doing more for God. I don't know what God's will for you life is, but I know it's probably not being a pokemon trainer. I know it's probably not constantly taking the path of least resistance.\n\nGod made you for a purpose. He's given you a course. Figure out what it is and get running. Get after it.\n\nThe second thing this teaches us is....\n\n2. What it teaches us about time\nPaul was concerned about finishing his course. He wasn't wasting time. In fact, the whole reason he has these guys come to Miletus instead of him just doing the natural thing and going to Ephesus is because he doesn't want to get bogged down and waste time. He wants to finish. He's very concerned about this.\n\nI have a friend in town, Dan Henry, that ran a Ironman Triathlon two weeks ago in Chattanooga. If you don't know what that is, that means he swam 2.2 miles, then got out of the water and got on a bike and road 112 miles, then got off the bike and ran a full marathon - all in the same day. That's what you call crazy. The cut off time for the Chattanooga Ironman was something like 16 hours and 30 minutes. Do you want to know what his finish time was? 16 hours, 29 minutes and 30 seconds. We were talking and he said that if he had stopped one extra time, just to chit chat with a passerby or walk and enjoy a banana or something, he would have got a DNF - a did not finish. There were people just a hundred yards behind him at the finish line who didn't get a finishers medal because of 30 seconds.\n\nI think that's the attitude Paul was showing here about the will of God. He wanted to make sure he got it done. He didn't want to waste any time. He didn't want to get to heaven and get a DNF.\n\nTwice in his epistles, once in Ephesians 5:16 and once in Collosians 4:5, Paul tells us we should be \"Redeeming the time.\" That means we live with a sense of urgency. We live like we have a job to do for God and we can't waste time.\n\nSo the lesson here, what it teaches us about time and the purpose God has given us is...\n\nWe have a limited time to do it.\nJesus, when He was on this earth said \"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh when no man can work\" (John 9:4)\n\nChurch member, Christian - you have a job to do for God. You have a God given purpose. You don't have infinite time to do it.\n\n\"Only one life so soon will pass, only what's done for God will last.\"\n\nChurch, don't waste your time. Find out what God wants you to do and get at it. Get doing it. Get off the couch. Wake up from your lethargy and find some way to serve the Lord.\n\nGod has a purpose for your life, a job for you do to, a course for you to run and you don't have forever to run it so get at it.\n\nThe third thing we see in this is:\n\n3. What it teaches us about ministry\nLook at verse 24 in our text again:\n\n\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.\"\n\nPaul not only talked about his \"course\" but he talked about \"the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus\" and Paul knew what His ministry was, his ministry was \"to testify of the gospel of the grace of God.\" His ministry was a gospel ministry.\n\nFurther on, in verse 26 Paul says \"I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God\"\n\nYou know, it's interesting, I was having a conversation with someone recently who is just getting into the Bible for the first time and they asked me about the subject of Hell. It's a tough subject to talk about. It's tough because if we lived like we believe what we say we believe about Hell, we'd have so much more urgency when it comes to the gospel.\n\nSo here is what this teaches us about the ministry:\n\nOur God-given purpose should further the gospel.\nI don't know what God's will is for you. It may not be to be a preacher. It may not be to be a missionary. I don't think those callings are for everyone. But I know that no matter what your calling from God is - it's going to forward the cause of the gospel. It's going to help the gospel be proclaimed.\n\nYou can further the gospel as a housewife. You can further the gospel as a factory worker. You can further the gospel in the office. When you go to the hardees in the morning to eat breakfast with the liars club - you can further the gospel. You can further the gospel at the YMCA. You can further the gospel in your classroom.\n\nWhatever your purpose in life is - whatever job God has you doing - your ministry should be furthering the gospel.\n\nLet me give you one more lesson from this passage - and I'm warning you, you aren't going to like it. It's a little edgy. It's a little blunt. But you need to hear it and I need to hear it.\n\nThe last thing is...\n\n4. What it teaches us about comfort\nLook one more time at verse 24:\n\n\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy\"\n\nNotice the beginning of the verse \"none of these things move me\" What is Paul talking about there? He was looking at his future and look at the verse 22:\n\n\"And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.\"\n\nPaul was saying, do you know what? I know God wants me to go to Jerusalem and I have no idea what is going to happen to me there - but I know this, I know that it includes \"bonds and afflictions\" I know I'm going to be incarcerated and I know I'm going to suffer - but none of these things move me.\n\nDo you realize that for Paul, everywhere he went he faced hardship. When he went to a new city - he probably didn't check out the local holiday inn, he checked out the jail because he knew that is where he was probably staying the night. I mean, turn with me real quick to 2 Corinthians 11.\n\n\"[2Co 11:23-28 KJV] 23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool ) I [am] more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft. 24 Of the Jews five times received I forty [stripes] save one. 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 26 [In] journeyings often, [in] perils of waters, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils by [mine own] countrymen, [in] perils by the heathen, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brethren; 27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.\"\n\nHere is the last thing I think we can learn from this passage about God's purpose for us:\n\nBeing comfortable doesn't have anything to do with it.\nWe live in a microwave society, a drive through society, a convenience society. People expect to be comfortable 100% of the time. They want to stay in their safe little bubbles. Church member, I don't know what God's will for your life is but I know that, most likely, it's going to force you out of your comfort zone.\n\nIt might move you away. It might have you working extra hours. It might make you sweaty and sore. It might cause you to have to speak up when you would prefer to be silent. You might have to teach the old dog new tricks. I don't know - I just know that if you study any of the people in the Bible who were serving God, they didn't stay in their comfort zones for long.\n\nSo let's stitch together all we've learned from this farewell address so far:\n\nGod has given each of us something to do, we have limited time to do it, it's going to further the gospel and it's going to stretch you out of your comfort zone.\n\nAre you running your course this morning? The Christian life isn't a spectator sport - so get off of the sidelines and get into the race. You don't have forever - so get running. It isn't a stroll, it's a race - so run hard. Do your part to further the gospel.",

    "body": "We are going to look again at Acts 20 tonight and we are going to take a more in depth look at what Paul said to the elders at Miletus. I just focused on verse 24 this morning, tonight we are going to look at verses 25-35.\n\nThese verses are about church leadership. When I determined years ago that I was going to preach through books of the Bible, the one thing I didn't count on was how often the subject of the text is church leadership. I don't want to skip over passages like this - because they are important for the church - but it's very awkward to talk about and to preach about.\n\nBut that is what we are going to look at tonight. So let's read verses 25 - 35 together and then I have 3 quick points for you.\n\n\"25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I [am] pure from the blood of all [men]. 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. 28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. 33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\"\n\nLike I said, this sermon is all about church leadership. It's directed to church leaders and it gives instructions for us. So we are going to look at it tonight.\n\nBut please don't check out. It's important that you know this stuff. It's Bible. Someday you might find yourself in another area looking for a church. Someday something may come up. You need to know what you believe about this stuff and you need to understand the scripture on it.\n\nSo we are going to break this down into three sections: the position of church leaders, the profession of church leaders and the pay of church leaders.\n\nLet's pray and we'll look at those:\n\nThe first thing I want us to look at is:\n\n1. The position of church leaders\nI believe there are three names for pastors in the new testament: elder, bishop and pastor. They all refer to the same thing, although they have a different emphasis. You can see all of those positional titles here in Acts 20.\n\nLook at verse 17:\n\n\"And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.\"\n\nNotice the word \"elders\" there. The first position of church leaders is:\n\nA. Elders (17)\nNow, the word \"elders\" is the greek word \"presbyteros\", it's the word we get the term \"presbyterian\" from. It's most basic use refers to age. That's how we use the word. But that isn't how it's used here.\n\nIn Bible times, the city council was called \"elders.\" They were a group that met together to discuss ideas and to lead the city or country.\n\nBut throughout the new testament, elders is used to refer to the leaders of the church. Now, there are two ideas about this that I think are off:\n\nOne the one hand, you have those who teach that the church should have an elder board that sits over the pastor and makes all of the decisions for the church. This is the presbyterian model. I just don't see churches in the New Testament being led this way and it's certainly not taught.\n\nOn the other hand, you have those who say \"well, elder is just a another term for pastor\" and they would say your church can only have one elder. That's sort of what we were taught in college. Well, if you look closely at this text, it blows that out of the water. Every time it talks about elders it talks about them in the plural - always \"elders\" never \"elder\" and every time it talks about the church it's always singular. Always \"elders of the church\" never \"elders of the churches\" or \"elder of the church.\"\n\nSo I think the middle ground position and the biblical position on elders is this - the church should be led by preachers and it's healthy to have more than one of them.\n\nThe second term we see here is:\n\nB. Overseers (28)\nIt says \"take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers.\"\n\nThat word \"overseer\" is the word \"episkopos\", its where the term \"episcopal\" comes from. This is the only time it's translated for us as \"overseer\", the other six times we see it in the New Testament it's translated as \"bishop.\"\n\nThayer's dictionary defines this word this way:\n\na man charged with the duty of seeing that things to be done by others are done rightly, any curator, guardian or superintendent\n\nSo the idea isn't that pastors are supposed to act like kings - that's not what bishop means - we are overseers - sort of like managers or superintends. We have a level of authority, but the authority doesn't come from us. It comes from God.\n\nBy the way, this word is also used in the plural whenever it references churches. It's only found 5 times. One of those times it refers to Jesus. Two of those times it refers to the qualifications of individual bishops. The other two times, the only times it actually references actual bishops, they are plural.\n\nThe last term for pastors is...\n\nC. Shepherds (28)\nThis passage doesn't use the word. In fact, it's only used a couple of times in the New Testament, but it's definitely inferred here.\n\nLook at verse 28 again:\n\n\"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.\"\n\nThe flock, that is a word straight out of shepherding. So, it's natural to read \"shepherd\" into this. A shepherd looks after, feeds, and protects the sheep - right?\n\nBut here is the thing that this passage and every other passage makes very clear - they aren't our sheep. We have been given the care of these sheep by the Holy Ghost - they are God's sheep.\n\nSo that's the position of church leaders. We aren't kings. We have a special authority, but it's got checks and balances.\n\nLet's look at number 2:\n\n2. The profession (work) of church leaders\nIn other words, what are church leaders supposed to be doing. This is what most of this is about:\n\nFirst, we are to:\n\nA. Lead the flock\nWe have been made overseers. Managers in a sense, of the church and we are to lead the flock.\n\nYou've got these churches that are board run. They have a board for everything. The pastoral leadership has no authority to do anything. That's not what we see in the Bible. In the Bible the pastors have authority and they are to \"take heed\" that they use it properly.\n\nSo, lead the flock. Second, we are to...\n\nB. Feed the flock\nLook at verse 28 again:\n\n\"Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.\"\n\nFeed the church of God.\n\nHow are we supposed to do that? Well, Paul tells us by example in verse 27, he says\n\n\"For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.\"\n\nWe feed the flock of God with the word of God.\n\nListen, it's not the pastor's job to be cute or to be funny. Every sermon doesn't have to bring you to tears or have you crying out for revival. It's just a meal.\n\nMost of the meals we have at my house aren't super spicy - my stomach couldn't handle that. They don't come on fancy china. They aren't works of art. They aren't super heavy. They aren't cotton candy. They are meals. What counts is that they nourish me.\n\nWherever you go to church - make sure that the preacher is a Bible preacher.\n\nThe third thing church leaders are supposed to be doing is:\n\nC. Warn the flock\nLook at verses 29-31\n\n\"For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.\"\n\nPaul said that there are going to be \"greivous wolves\" that entered in among you. I think he was saying that there were going to be pastors who could only be described as \"greivous wolves.\" Remember, we are talking about a flock of sheep here - what does a wolf do? He devours the flock.\n\nLook folks, I'm a pastor. I love pastors. I want to do everything I can to help good pastors, but can I tell you something - there are a lot. A LOT of crooked pastors out there. The people in this world I am most proud to call my brothers are pastors. Some of the people in this world who I think the least of are pastors. Some of them are just wolves.\n\nDo you know it is the job of church leadership to warn about the wolves.\n\nThere is a church across town that teaches it's people that only people who go there are saved and if you leave that church you are going to hell. They are wolves.\n\nIf you go to a church where the pastor is a dictator and tries to bully people into getting his way - he's a wolf.\n\nIf you have a pastor who is using his position in the church to be unfaithful to his wife or worse - to abuse kids - he's a wolf.\n\nIf you have a church that is struggling financially and a pastor who insists on living like a king he's a wolf.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point...\n\n3. The pay of church leaders\nVerses 33-35 address this:\n\n\"[Act 20:33-35 KJV] 33 I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. 34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. 35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.\"\n\nPaul was telling these preachers that he had worked with his own two hands not only to support himself but also to support other preachers. So the lesson here is:\n\nA. They ought to be willing to work.\nPastors ought to be hard workers. They ought to be willing to support themselves. Paul was a great example of this. He didn't work to be rich. He worked to support his ministry. He worked so that his ministry could take the offerings and use them elsewhere.\n\nHe also wrote about how it was totally appropriate for churches to pay a pastor - but that wasn't the norm.\n\nPaul worked in Corinth for his long stay there and apparently he worked in Ephesus.\n\nThe second thing this says about church leaders is:\n\nB. They ought to be willing to give.\nRemember, when Paul says \"So labouring ye ought to support the weak.\" He's talking to pastors.",

    "body": "# James 1:26-27\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve had this conversation with someone:\n\n**Me:** Are you a Christian? Do you go to church?\n**Them:** No, all Christians are a bunch of hypocrites.\n\nOr here is another variation:\n\n**Me:** Are you a Christian?  Do you go to church?\n**Them:** Mr. So-and-So goes to church, and all he cares about is getting rich.  He doesn’t care about us at all.\n\nOr here is one more:\n\n**Me:** We would love to have you join us in church sometime.\n**Them:** I worship God my own way. I’m a spiritual person. I don’t need church.\n\nLots of people claim to be followers of Jesus. They claim to love God, but their life doesn’t match up.  This is a real problem that hinders our witness.  \n\nI think this is more of a problem the more “religious” your town is.  Mattoon is kind of a “Bible-belty” type of town.  We’ve got less than 20,000 people and more than forty churches.  Most people in our town would claim to be Christians.  There is a lot of “cultural Christianity” where you have people who go to church because it’s a socially acceptable exercise and not necessarily out of a heart of devotion.  \n\nWhat happens is you have a lot of goats; a lot of tares.  Lost people see that, and they see right through it and think, “You guys don’t live any differently than we do. What’s the point?”\n\nThis is the problem that out text tonight is going to deal with.  It’s just two short verses at the very end of James 1.  Let’s read it together:\n\n> *”If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.  Pure religion and undefined before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself I spotted from the world.”*\n\n\nThe government estimates that counterfeiting costs the American economy over 200 billion dollars each year and that it costs about 750,000 lost American jobs.  The United States Secret Service takes counterfeiting very, very seriously.  It’s a real problem.\n\nBut it’s not just money that’s counterfeited.  Let’s say you have a great idea for a new invention, and you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars developing it, getting the proper patents, and getting it manufactured and marketed.  Because of all this, you have to price it to pay back your investment.  Well, some guy in China gets a hold of your awesome widget, and he says, “I can build an exact replica of this for pennies and sell it on Amazon.”  That would ruin your business.  It happens every day.\n\nSo how do you tell a fake?  How do you tell a phony?  \n\nThese verses are all about how to tell the difference between phony or fake religion and the real thing.  For our outline tonight, we are going to talk about two things:\n\n1. What fake religion can and cannot do.\n2. How to tell if your religion is fake or real.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll jump into our message:**\n\nThe first thing I want to preach on tonight from these verses is...\n\n# 1. What fake religion can and cannot do:\nLook at verse 26 again:\n\n> *”If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.”*\n\nThere are several interesting words in there:\n\nThe word *religious* is a unique word that is only found in these verses.  It talks about our outward show of religion—our outward acts of worship.\n\nWhat it is saying is that if a person is going through the motions of outward worship—if they are going to church, if they are singing hymns, if they are getting dressed up on Sunday—but they aren’t doing some things we’ll talk about in a minute, then their worship or their religion is *vain*.\n\nThat’s another interesting word.  *Vain* here means pointless, useless, and worthless.\n\nSo the problem here is phony worship—counterfeit worship.  It’s worthless.\n\nI once bought a Rolex watch and some Ray Ban sunglasses on the street in Juárez for about $20.  They weren’t worth $20.  They were worthless junk masquerading as something valuable.  They were phonies.  They were fakes.\n\nNow, there are two things these verses teach us that fake, phony, worthless religion can do, first...\n\n## A. Fake religion can fool others.\n\nThe verse says *”if any man among you seem to be religious.”*\n\nYou can go through the motions and seem to others to be religious when all you have is a fake, phony, counterfeit Christianity.  It happens all the time.\n\nAll over the New Testament, there are instances when Jesus is preaching in basically a church—a synagogue—and he is opposed by demon-possessed people.  Get this: Demon-possessed people in the synagogue.  They were fakers.\n\nThe biggest opposition Jesus faced on this earth didn’t come from the Roman government or the worldly Herodians. It came from the Pharisees—the religious guys.\n\nLet’s be honest. All you have to do is put on some respectable clothes, show up at a church once or twice a month, and daydream through a sermon, and most people will assume you are a true Christian trying to live the Christian life.  It’s not that hard.\n\nFake religion can fool other people.  You can “seem to be religious,” but your religion can be pointless.\n\nFake religion can fool other people and the other thing fake religion can do is...\n\n## B. Fake religion can fool you.\n\nLook at the verse again. It says *but deceiveth his own heart.*\n\nIt’s one thing to fool others, but quite another to fool yourself, to fool your heart.  But you can do it.  If you lie to yourself enough, you will start to believe your own lie.\n\nThe world likes to say “trust your heart” and “follow your heart,” but the BIble says that *”the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, who can know it?”*(Jeremiah 17:9)\n\nYou can deceive yourself.  \n\n* “I’m a good person.”  \n* “I’m a good Christian.”\n* “I go to to church.”\n* “I give in the offering.”\n* “I don’t lie...that much.”\n\nIt’s self-deception.  Being in church doesn’t make you a Christian any more than being in a garage makes you a car.  Don’t lie to yourself.  Don’t fall for a fake Christianity.  Don’t buy the counterfeit.\n\nPhony religion can fool others.  Phony religion can fool yourself, but one thing phony religion can’t do is seen in the next verse:\n\nNotice it says:\n\n> *”Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this.”*\n\nWhat phony religion can’t do is...\n\n## C. Fake religion cannot fool God.\n\nGod is looking.  God is watching.  He knows a fake when he sees it.  He’s like the Secret Service or the treasury. He can spot a counterfeit. \n\nYou might be able to pull the wool over other people’s eyes. You might have been doing it long enough that you even start to believe it yourself, but God isn’t fooled.\n\nMany times in the gospels, it tells us that Jesus knew what people were thinking.  The Bible teaches us that God sees our hearts and He knows our thoughts.\n\nJeremiah 17:10 says:\n\n> *”I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.”*\n\nGod knows a phony. He can tell a fake, and you won’t be able to fool him.\n\n---\n\nSo listen: If fake religion can fool others and fool ourselves but it can’t fool God, how do we tell if our religion or worship is real?  I mean, we aren’t God. How do we tell if others religion is real?\n\nThat’s our second point...\n\n## 2. How to tell if your religion is fake or real.\nJust like a anti-counterfeiter knows for specific details to look for to tell if a bill is real, James gives us three specific details to look for in a persons life to see if their religion is real or phony. \n\nIt’s important that we understand that these aren’t the only things.  It’s not an exhaustive list, but it’s the list James gives us here.\n\nThe first thing it tells us about people with real religion is...\n\n## A. People with real religion keep their tongues under control.\n\nVerse 26 says:\n\n> *”If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.”*\n\nSo the first thing is bridling your tongue.  \n\nI don’t know if you’ve ever spent any time around horses.  They are huge animals. They are really intimidating.\n\nDown in Tennessee, we had this annual carnival fundraiser for the school, and all of the teachers had to help.  Somehow, I always ended up on horse duty, walking the horses around in a circle giving horseback rides.  I think whoever planned the thing thought, “Who would be most uncomfortable around horses? I know! Ryan! Let’s make him do it!” Horses are huge, strong animals, and if they wanted to knock me over or push me around, it would be no contest.\n\nBut horses have this really sensitive space between their front teeth and their back teeth and you can put a piece of metal in there and attach some straps to it, and the horse will do what you want it to (for the most part). That is called a bit and bridle, so when it says *“bridleth not his tongue,”* what it’s talking about here is controlling your tongue.\n\nJust like a huge horse, your mouth can be this really strong force with a mind of its own, and when it’s out of control, it can cause a lot of damage.  \n\nIf you read this book, James keeps coming back to this over and over and over again.  You have to keep your mouth under control.  You have to watch your tongue and your words.\n\nNow why is that?   Why is this an acid test for true spirituality?\n\nHere’s why: Your tongue is a direct reflection of your heart.  Jesus said to the Pharisees in Matthew 12:34:\n\n> *”for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.”*\n\nHere is the deal: If God is controlling your mouth and if God is controlling your words, then God is controlling your heart.  If your mouth is out of control, that means your heart is out of control, too, and God isn’t controlling that.\n\nSo the first acid test of real religion is your tongue.  Do you keep it under control or is it out of control?\n\nA second test of true Christianity in these verses is...\n\n## B. People with real religion look out for the needy.\n\nVerse 27 says:\n\n> *”Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction.”*\n\nSo I did some word studies here.  The word *visit* in these verses means “to check in on to help” or “to look after.”  \n\n*Fatherless* is another word for “orphans.”  It can also refer to any needy people.\n\n*Widows* of course means “widows,” but remember that in the Bible times, if a woman lost her husband, very often she had no way to support herself and could be destitute.\n\nSo orphans and the fatherless were really, really destitute people. The word *affliction* means pressure, anguish, persecution, and trouble.  These people were really, really hard up.\n\nSo James says that if you want to see if your religion is real, try to help the people who are most hard-up in society, the people who are struggling the most.  \n\nNow this might seem totally strange to you.  It’s certainly not something that is emphasized often, but if you are a child of God, that means you’ll resemble your Heavenly Father. The Bible has a lot to say about God’s heart for the poor and helpless.\n\nLook at Psalm 68:5.\n\n> *”A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, [is] God in his holy habitation.”*\n\nGod calls himself a father to the fatherless and a judge (or a deliverer) of the widows.  In other words, God really has a soft spot for those who are truly in need, and He takes up to help them.\n\nIn the late 1800s, there was this movement that was launched called the Social Gospel that was all about helping poor people and ridding the wrongs of society.  It went too far.  It overshadowed the actual gospel, and it turned churches into aid centers instead of Bible centers.  \n\nAnother thing that’s happened in recent history is the Democratic Party in America has taken two positions simultaneously.  They portray themselves as the party that cares about the poor and the destitute and those that are down and out, and at the same time they support and push lots of things the Bible is plainly against, like abortion and gay marriage.\n\nSo Bible-believing churches tried to distance themselves from the social gospel crowd and from caring about the poor, and I think we’ve gone too far.  We as Christians and we as a church should care about the destitute and needy.  We should care about the housing project kids.  We can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater and ignore the needs of the less privileged.\n\nI want you to imagine some of the kids I met when I worked in the inner city.  They live in a violent, filthy housing project.  Their mother is addicted to drugs and probably sells herself as a prostitute.  She can’t string three words together coherently.  There are four kids in the house, all boys.  The oldest is 13.  All have different dads.  Every one of the dads is in prison.\n\nThe kids basically look out for themselves.  They have no furniture besides a big screen TV and a big couch, both of which could probably be repossessed by the rent-to-own company at any minute.\n\nThey go to horrible schools with almost illiterate graduates and huge dropout rates.  They see violent crime and unspeakable immorality almost every day of their lives even as children.  They have almost no positive role models in their life.\n\nAnd they are children.  They didn’t ask for that.  They didn’t have any control over their parents’, their grandparents’, and great-grandparents’ sins.  They are just as innocent as our children.  \n\nNow let me ask you something: Do you think God has compassion on those people?  I do.  I think he expects us to have compassion on them, too.\n\nHow do you treat needy people?  Do you look after them?  Do you care?\n\nJames is going to come back to this point too. \n\nThe third acid test James gives us of true religion is...\n\n## C. People with real religion aren’t worldly people.\n\nIt says *”to keep himself unspotted from the world.”*\n\nWe have to remember that the word “world” in the Bible doesn’t refer to the globe or the earth.  It refers to the world system.  It refers to this system of people living for things other than God.  One author said it is **“anything and everything at odds with the lordship of Christ in our life.”**\n\nRomans 12:2 says:\n\n> *”And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.”*\n\nWe aren’t supposed to be like the world.  Molding to its ways.  We are supposed to be different.\n\n1 John 2:15-17 says:\n\n> *”Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”*\n\nPeople with real religion aren’t living for the same things as the lost world.  They aren’t watching the same things; they aren’t reading the same things; they aren’t partaking in the same activities.  They are marching to the beat of a different drum.\n\nPhony religion is worldly religion.  It is religion that just backs up what the world is saying.  \n\nI was reading in my devotions this morning and I read a verse that applies to this.  Micah 2:11 says:\n\n> *”If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.”*\n\nThere are plenty of religious people who just want their ears tickled.  They want a preacher to tell them that it’s ok to go get drunk and party.  They want a preacher that will look the other way at adultery, look the other way at lust, look the other way when they are living just like the world in every imaginable way and just tacking on a little church on Sunday.\n\nBut that kind of religion is a counterfeit.  It’s phony.  If you claim to be a bible believing, God-saved Christian and yet you are just dripping with the world in every possible way.  That’s phoniness.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI read an article today about a fairly new problem that is spreading because of the internet.  Apparently, there are people who are manufacturing counterfeit cancer pills and marketing them on the internet at people who have just had a cancer diagnosis.  These pills can have no active ingredient, or the wrong dose and can potentially kill people.\n\nCounterfeit cancer pills.\n\nImagine being diagnosed with cancer and given pills that are supposed to save your life.  You dutifully take the pills as the doctor prescribed.  You go on like this for months.  Only to find that the pills are fakes, they are counterfeits, and that all this time cancer has been spreading in your body.\n\nThis world is sick and it needs Jesus. Jesus is the only answer to the great problems this world is facing.  People need Jesus and they are supposed to see Jesus in our lives and hear Jesus in our words.  But far too often, what they are getting is a counterfeit.  \n\nYou might be able to fool others.  You might even be able to deceive yourself.  But phony religion never fools God.\n\n* Are you watching your tongue?\n* Do you care about the down and out?\n* Are you worldly?\n\nLet’s have true religion.  Let’s be the real deal.  Let’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "My kids wanted to watch the movie \"Peabody and Sherman\" with me.  So I watched it with them.  It was cute.  Peabody of course is this genius dog, and Sherman is his adopted son and the story revolves around Peabody's signature invention \"the way back machine.\"  A Time machine.\n\nImagine if you had a \"way back machine\" - what would you want to see?  The Boston Tea Party?  The signing of the declaration of independence?  Martin Luther nailing the 95 thesis to the Wittenberg door?\n\nI know what I would want to see.  I would want to hear the sermons of many famous preachers who have gone on to be with the Lord.  I'd go to London in the 1860s and hear Charles Spurgeon preach. I'd go to Chicago in the 1950s and hear Harry Ironside.  Maybe while I was there I would zip across town and listen to Bob Ketcham preach.  I'd want to see D. Martyn Lloyd Jones in London and Harold Sightler and Vance Havner and A.W. Tozer. Maybe I would even go way way back and hear Jonathan Edwards or George Whitfield.\n\nBut I know two preachers I would definitely want to hear: Jesus and the Apostle Paul.\n\nWe think of the apostle Paul as a preacher, and we should, but do you know that there are only two full length sermons from Paul recorded in Acts?  We are going to look at one of them tonight.  \n\nTurn with me to Acts 13 one more time and we'll look at one of those sermons.  We've already studied this chapter twice, but we skipped over this part.  Let's read verses 16-41\n\n> *\"Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience. The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it. And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness. And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he divided their land to them by lot. And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet. And afterward they desired a king:and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years. And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will. Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus: When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose. Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent. For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him. And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain. And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the dead: And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption\"*\n\n> *\"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish:for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you\"*\n\nWe can't hear the Apostle Paul preach.  Even if we could, we wouldn't understand it, because he was preaching in Greek and none of us speak Koine Greek.  But we can read what he said.\n\nSo what did Paul preach when he got this great opportunity.  He preached three things, and they are all things we need to still be preaching today.  \n\nLet's pray and I'll give you those three things:\n\n\nThe first thing that we see that Paul preached is...\n\n# 1. Paul preached the Bible.\n\nNotice that...\n\n## His message was a Bible message.\n\nI want you to notice that Paul went through the scripture with this message.  He was just preaching what the Bible said.  In verses 16-23 Paul gives a summary of the whole of Old testament history - up until David.  \n\nPaul was no dummy.  Even secular people who look back at the apostle Paul recognize that the man was brilliant.  He could have used any argument that he wanted to.  He could have gone to philosophy, to current events, to history, to science.  You know from the Bible that Paul knew all of that stuff - but he didn't - he went to the scripture and he drew his message from the scripture.\n\nChurch - listen to me.  It is not the job of the preacher to make you feel good.  It is the job of the preacher to tell you what God's word says.  It's not my job to get up here on Sunday morning and preach to you from Time Magazine or from Reader's Digest.  It's not my job to preach to you about politics or current events.  It's not my job to give you pop psychology. It's the job of the preacher to say \"thus saith the Lord\" and the only place that we can find that is in the scripture.\n\nLook - I have opinions.  I have lots of opinions.  But you don't need my opinions - you need the word of God.  I could tell you stories till you were sick of hearing them - but you don't need stories, you need the word of God.\n\nWhen you judge a sermon - don't judge it by how it made you feel.  Don't judge it by how dynamic the speaker was.  Don't judge it by how much he yelled and screamed and stomped his feet.  Don't judge it by the number of \"amens.\"  Judge it by this and this alone **\"Did the preacher help me to understand better what the Bible says, and do I feel compelled to obey it?\"**\n\n---\n\nHis message was a Bible message.  But notice it wasn't just a message drawn from the Bible...\n\n## His arguments were Bible arguments.\n\nPaul is going to be making arguments about Jesus and who Jesus is.  But with every argument about Jesus being the savior, Jesus being the messiah, Jesus being resurrected, with every one - Paul goes to the scripture and backs up his argument with scripture.\n\nDo you know why?  Because the scriptures have final authority.  The word of God is the word of God.\n\nLook - you can disagree with my opinions.  If I stand up and preach my opinions - and you say \"Ok, pastor, that sounds good and all but I don't agree.\"  There is nothing wrong with that.\n\nBut if I carefully stick to the Bible and I give you what the Bible says and you walk away and say \"I don't agree with that.\" Then you aren't disagreeing with me - you are disagreeing with the Bible.  You are disagreeing with God.\n\nIt's my job not only to help you understand the Bible, it's my job to do so with such clarity and authority that you understand \"this is really what God is saying and I can either obey this or disobey God.\"\n\nThat's preaching with authority.\n\nLook - our authority isn't me yelling.  It isn't me getting all emotional.  Real authority comes when we see \"this is the word of God and we better obey it.\"\n\nSo Paul preached a Bible message.  Church, that's what the world needs to hear from us - the Bible.  It's still as relevant today as it was in Jesus' day.  Fashions may change.  Moral's may change - but this is the book that will last forever.  This book is the anchor that will keep us safe in the troubled seas of modern change. \n\nOn our logo, I don't know if you've noticed this, but there are words that are underneath it. Underneath it it says \"it lives, it speaks, it changes lives.\"\n\nThat's not a reference to our church.  That's a reference to the Bible.  The Bible is the only book that is alive.  \n\nHebrews 4:12 says\n\n> *\"For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.\"*\n\nThe word of God is quick - it's alive.  And it speaks to us in a powerful way.\n\nIt's still speaking to the issues of today.  It's still guiding us.\n\nAnd do you know what? It changes lives. You find Jesus in this book, you find truth in this book, it changes lives.\n\nThere is a song I love and it's chorus says:\n\n```\nGod's Word changes lives\nIts power cannot be denied\nThe lost find salvation, the foolish become wise\nGod's Word changes lives\n```\n\nSo Paul preached the Bible.  But there was one specific message from the Bible that Paul wanted people to hear. \n\nNotice that...\n\n#  2. Paul preached Jesus.\n\nIn verse 23 Paul gets where he is going.  He gets to the main point.  Everything else so far has been runway.  But this is what he wants to talk to these people about.  Look what he says:\n\n> *\"Of this man's seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus\"*\n\nPaul preached the Bible - but in order to really understand what the Bible says you have to understand what the Bible is all about - and the Bible is all about Jesus.  Everything from Genesis to Matthew points forward to Jesus.  Matthew, Mark, Luke and John tell the story of Jesus, then everything else looks back at Jesus.  It's all about Jesus.\n\nPeople need the Bible - but more than that, they need the Christ of the Bible. The Bible may be the vehicle for our message - but Jesus IS our message.  Paul said in 1 Corinthians 1:23-24 \n\n> *\"We preach Christ crucified, unto the jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness, but unto them which are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.\"*\n\nHe said in Romans 1:16\n\n> *\"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek\"*\n\nHe said in 2 Corinthians 4:5\n\n> *\"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord.\"*\n\nI could go on and on.  Because truly, this is the theme of the whole Bible.  This is what it's all about.  It's all about Jesus.\n\nThis book contains rules - but it's not all about rules.  It contains prophecy - but its not a book about Prophecy.  There is plenty of pithy wisdom in this book - but it's not a self-help book.  It's a book about Jesus.\n\nAnd when Paul got a chance to preach - 10 times out of 10 He was going to preach Jesus.  \n\nSomebody asked Charles Spurgeon, the famous british preacher to describe his method and here is what he said, \"“I take my text and make a bee-line to the cross.”\n\nPaul preached Jesus, but notice in our text HOW he preached Jesus:\n\n## He preached Jesus prophesied. (21-23)\n\nHe went to the Old Testament and went through Old Testament history and as you are reading this you are thinking - ok Paul, where are you going with this.  He was trying to show these people that Christ was prophesied in the Old Testament.  That's what the word \"Christ\" means - it is the same word as \"messiah.\"  Jesus is the promised one.\n\nBut Paul didn't stay there, He told them WHY the Old testament promised Jesus...\n\n## He preached Jesus the savior (23b-29)\n\nIn verses 23 Paul says:\n\n> *\"God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus\"*\n\nHe took them to the cross.  He told them that the Jews senselessly took this promised one and killed him in the most unimaginable way possible. But - and you have to think like people who are hearing this for the first time like this audience was - He didn't present it as a bad thing.\n\nThink about this - let me tell you some good news, the person that was promised to save us has come - WooHoo!  Yes!  Ticker tape parade!  Dancing in the streets!  The savior is come!  Yes - and we killed Him!  Woohoo!  Yay!  Wait - why are you not cheering???\n\nImagine how strange that must have sounded to be told messiah had come and that the Jews had killed Him and to be told it with a smile on your face like it's a good thing. \n\nHow could Paul preach Jesus this way?\n\nLook at one more thing?\n\n## He preached Jesus triumphant (30-36)\n\nI know I alrady read a lengthy passage but let me read verses 29-37 again:\n\n> *\"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre. But God raised him from the dead: And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people. And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers, God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David. Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption\"*\n\nHere was what Paul was getting at.  Jesus. Jesus has come and He's fulfilled all of the promises. He's come to be our savior.  And He was killed - but He also fulfilled another promise - one you forgot about - He rose from the dead.\n\nHe truly is the Messiah.  He truly is the son of God.\n\n---\n\nNow, I want to stop here.  So Paul preached the Bible - He preached Jesus.  But there is a question every preacher must ask with every message: so what?  What does it matter to me?  How does this effect me?  \n\nLook at the third thing Paul preached and we'll be done:\n\n# 3. Paul preached the need to believe.\n\nLook at verses 38-42:\n\n> *\"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses. Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets; Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish:for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you\"*\n\nPaul didn't leave these people hanging.  He told them what God expected of them and he told them the consequences if they didn't do it.  He told them the best news they could ever hear and then he told them that they needed to act on it. They needed to believe.  \n",

    "body": "Question: Why Do Christians Not Drink Alcohol?\n\n1. Is there a clear command in the Bible saying that all believers should completely abstain from drinking alcohol?\n\nA. The closest we come to a general command is found in Prov. 20:1 and Prov. 23:31.\n“Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.”\n“Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.”\n\nB. Certain groups of people were commanded to abstain from drinking alcohol:\n\ta. The priests (Lev. 10:9) – “Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.”\n\tb. Israelites during the wilderness wanderings (Deut. 29:6) – “Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.”\n\tc. The Nazarites (Num. 6:3-4) – Samson (Judges 16:17) and John the Baptist (Luke 1:15)\n\td. Kings (Prov. 31:4-5) – “It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.”\n\te. Pastors and deacons (I Tim. 3:3, 8)\n\nC. Certain individuals in the Bible chose to abstain from drinking alcohol:\n\ta. Daniel (Dan. 1:8) – “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.”\n\tb. Timothy (I Tim. 5:23) – “Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.”\n\tc. The Rechabites (Jer. 35:6-14)\n\nD. Examples of people in the Bible who drank alcohol:\n\ta. Noah (Gen. 9:21)\n\tb. Lot (Gen. 19:32)\n\tc. Nabal (I Sam. 25:36)\n\td. Uriah (II Sam. 11:13)\n\te. Amnon (II Sam. 13:28-29)\n\tf. Belshazzar (Dan. 5:1-6)\n\nE. There are many clear commands and condemnations in the Bible against drunkenness:\n\ta. Isa. 5:11-12, 22 – “Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine inflame them! And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands…Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink.”\n\tb. Hab. 2:15 – “Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!”\n\tc. Luke 21:34 – “And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.”\n\td. Rom. 13:13 – “Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.”\n\te. Gal. 5:19-21\n\tf. Eph. 5:18 – “And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit.”\n\tg. I Thess. 5:7-8 – “For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.”\n\n2. What about Jesus turning the water into wine (John 2:9-10) and drinking from the cup at the Last Supper (Matt. 26:27-29)?\n\nA. Two main words used when speaking of potentially alcoholic beverages:\na. Wine – yayin (Hebrew) and oinos (Greek)\nb. Strong Drink – shekar (word “sugar” is derived from)\n\nB. Note that Jesus never calls it “wine” during the Last Supper; only the cup (and the same when Paul speaks of the Lord’s Supper in I Cor. 11:23-28).\n\n3. What about the idea of being a casual/social drinker as long as you don’t get drunk?\n\nA. First of all, if you need to drink in order to be “social” and fit in, you’re probably running in the wrong social circles. Prov. 23:20 says, “Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh.”\n\nB. It is much easier to get drunk off of alcohol now than it was in Bible times. In Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, Chicago: Moody, 1980, Vol. I, p. 376, it says in reference to wine of Bible days: “not fortified with extra alcohol. Concentrated alcohol was only known in the Middle Ages when the Arabs invented distillation (‘alcohol’ is an Arabic word) so what is now called liquor or strong drink (i.e., whiskey, gin, etc.) and the twenty per cent fortified wines were unknown in Bible times. The strength of natural wines is limited by two factors. The percentage of alcohol will be half of the percentage of the sugar in the juice. And if the alcoholic content is much above 10 or 11 percent, the yeast cells are killed and fermentation ceases. Probably ancient wines were 7-10 per cent…to avoid the sin of drunkenness, mingling of wine with water was practiced. This dilution was specified by the rabbis in New Testament times for the wine customary at Passover.” \n\nC. Can you honestly say you as a Christian consuming alcohol would bring glory to God (I Cor. 10:31-32)? How would it help your testimony among unbelievers or among fellow Christians?\n\nD. The dangers of addiction (Prov. 23:29-35) – In I Cor. 6, Paul said, “All things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.”\n\nE. Statistics about alcohol\na. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), there are over 80,000 alcohol-related deaths in the U.S. each year. Alcohol poisoning kills six people every day. Alcohol-impaired driving accounts for more than 30% of driving fatalities each year. Drunk driving costs the U.S. $199 billion every year. Teen alcohol use kills 4,700 people each year. There are 1.4 million drunk driving arrests in the US every year.\nb. 696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are assaulted by another student who has been drinking.  97,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 report experiencing alcohol-related sexual assault or date rape. Roughly 20 percent of college students meet the criteria for AUD.\nc. A US Department of Justice study found that as many as 40% of violent crimes occur under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is the fourth leading cause of mortality in the country. More than 10% of all U.S. children live with a parent who abuses alcohol.\nd. 86% of people aged 18 years and more reported drinking at least once during their lifetime. 71% of people in the same age group reported that they drank during the past year while 56.9% drank in the past month. 8% of full-time college students aged between 18 and 22 years reported that they consumed alcohol in the past month. 7% of teens aged 15 years reported that they drank at least once during their lifetime. 8% of individuals aged between 12 and 20 years reported drinking in the past month. Research shows that people who start drinking before the age of 15 are 4 times more likely to meet the criteria for alcohol dependence at some point in their lives. ",

    "body": "*Now his elder son was in the field:and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. And he was angry, and would not go in:therefore came his father out, and intreated him. And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad:for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found*\n\nTonight, we are going to finish our little mini-series on the story of the Prodigal Son.  So far, we’ve focused on God’s grace and mercy.  We were the prodigal, and at every point the Father has shown us amazing mercy and grace. That’s the wonderful part of this story.  \n\nBut that's not all of this story.\n\nBut there is one more element, and one more character that we can relate to in this story - and I think he may be the main character - although he usually gets ignored: The older brother.\n\nThe story closes with the older brother, confronting the father.  There is no resolution.  It doesn't close with the Father making up with the older brother.  It doesn't close with the older brother hugging his brother and going into the feast.  It closes with a tension.  It closes in the older brother's court.\n\nWhy is that?  Have you ever thought about why this is such an open ended story?\n\nEvery story has a context and the context of this one is important.  So look with me at chapter 15 verse 1.\n\n> *\"Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him. And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them\"*\n\nSo this verse tells us two things about the context of this story.  \n\n1st, it tells us about the **audience** of the story - who was it?  The Pharisees.  \n\nYou do remember who the Pharisees were don't you?  This morning, Dr. Reichman kept talking about the \"hassidic\" jews.  The hassidic jews is the modern day name for the Pharisees.  They were extremely religious people who lived by the letter of the law.  They memorized all five books of the Torah.  Did you notice this morning that, when Dr. Riechman was talking about the sabbath, that he said that they waited until 6:30 to light their candle.  Why 6:30? when the sabbath was over at 6?\n\nAnother thing he said was that in these Hassidic families you often have separate kitchens for meat and dairy.  I asked him why?  There is one phrase in the old testament that says \"don't seethe a kid in his mother's milk.\"  That's it.  It doesn't say \"don't cook meat in milk\" it certainly doesn't say \"keep meat and milk separate\" but the Pharisees have taught that, just to be careful, you have to keep them separated and today, it's gone so far that you have families literally building matching kitchens so they never even have the milk and the meat in the same room.\n\nThat's the Pharisees.  \n\nIt reminds me of an illustration I've heard many times before.  Many times I've heard the illustration of a stage coach and a cliff.  The story goes that a king was looking for a new stage coach driver and held tryouts.  He told the drivers to drive near a treacherous piece of road with a cliff.  The drivers started making it a contest to see who could get the closest to the cliff edge.  But one stage coach rider stayed as far away from the cliff as he could and he got the job.\n\nWhat's the lesson of that story?  Err on the side of caution.  Obeying God's laws aren't enough - you have to go even further.  That's the lesson.  The cliff is seething a kid in it's mothers milk - so the Pharisees wont even eat meat that's been on the same plate as a dairy product.  The cliff is that the Sabbath is over at 6pm, but the Pharisees say \"Let's go to 6:30 just to be safe.\"  Do you get it?\n\nAnd let me just say this - life's not a cliff.  It's more like a bridge.  And if you stay too far from one edge, you'll end up going over the other. \n\nWell, what does this have to do with the older brother?  What does this have to do with the story of the prodigal son?\n\nThe moral of the story is hinted at in verse 1 too.  You see, Jesus was telling this story to confront a problem.  The problem was that the Pharisees were thinking low of Jesus because He was hanging out with publicans and sinners.  He was hanging out with people who weren't church people.\n\nAnd their sneer, their attitude was \"we are better than Jesus because we are separated and we won't hang out with those sinners.\"\n\nAnd in that context Jesus tells this story.\n\nSo, think about it again.  And think about the people hearing it.  They are a religious crowd.  They are extremely observant of all of the religious customs.\n\nThey've been hearing this story about the boy who demanded his inheritance.  I asked Dr. Reichman about this over lunch and he said that the jewish response would have been to stone him.  The pharisees would have stoned this younger brother.\n\nThen he goes off and wastes his living with harlots.  They would have stoned him for that too.\n\nThen he eats from the pig trough - and now it's gone too far.  He is beyond unclean.  \n\nHe is a father-dishonoring, sexually immoral, swine herd.  He's about as low as you can go in the eyes of the Pharisees.\n\nBut then Jesus talks about the older brother.  He's upright.  He never left his father's side.  He's observed all of the rules.  He's been the good son.\n\nIf there was a person in this story who the Pharisees could identify with - it would be this older son.  That was them:  Scrupulous, devout, hard-working.\n\nAnd that's exactly what Jesus was trying to do with this story.  I think He was trying to aim this right at the heart of these Pharisees.  \n\nWhat I want to do tonight is give you four points about the older brother, and as we look at these, remember, this is religious people.  This isn't the guy who is living hard and loose.  This is for the guy who comes to church on a Sunday night.   This is for you.  This is for me.\n\nOk.  So the first thing is...\n\n## The relationship of the older brother - cold and distant.\n\nOne of the obvious things about this story is that the older brother does not have a very warm relationship with his father.  There are several clues to this:\n\nFirst, it would have been the older brother's job to put together a party like this.  This older brother was never included - which probably meant something was up in the family.\n\nSecond, notice the way that he talks to the father and says \"this thy son.\"  There is no respect whatsoever in this older brother.  \n\nThird, when he complains he says \"You never gave me a calf so I could make merry with...\"  who?  The family?  You?  No, my friends.\n\nThis older brother does not have a good relationship with his father.  Not at all.\n\nDo you a lot of religious people might be doing all they can to meet the heavenly father's criteria - but they don't really have a love for their father.  They don't really have a relationship with their father.  There religion is cold and distant.\n\nI think it even goes further here - I think the older brother really hated his father.  He resented his father.  He was just trying to use His father.\n\nWhich brings me to the second point:\n\n## The righteousness of the older brother - based on works.\n\nNotice what the elder brother says to His father:\n\n> *\"Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment:and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends\"*\n\nThe word \"serve\" there is actually a strong word.  It carries the idea of \"slaving for you.\"\n\nNow, think about this.  Think about it.  How does this son view his father?  As a slavemaster.  He wants his father's property and he's willing to work for it  but he resents his father and views him as a slave master.\n\nSo the elder brother is really after the same thing the younger brother is after - he's after his father's property - but the elder brother is getting it by works and the younger brother got it by demanding it.  They are both just using the father to get what they are after.  One of them is just doing it in a way society thinks is respectable and other isn't.  But at the heart - it's both the same.\n\nDo you know there are plenty of people who go to church and do good not because they love God but because they love themselves.  They do it because it's respectable.  They do it because it works out better for them.  They do it because it helps their business.  \n\nThey don't love God - they view God like a computer program.  They put in the right things and they get out what they want.  They view God like a gauntlet that they have to run through.  \n\nEver talk to a guy about his job and you ask him how he likes it and he's like \"err - it's a paycheck.\"  They don't love their job - they love what their job gives them - and that's the way many religious people are.  They may be squeaky clean on the outside but they are just that way because they want something and when they don't get it that's when the real them comes out.\n\nIt's works based righteousness.\n\nYou see something else about this older brother and it's true of religious people too. You see...\n\n## The rage of the older brother - hated grace.\n\nThis older brother hated grace.  \n\n## The response to the older brother - mercy.\n\n## The replacement for this older brother - Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "The hardest part for us about living in Illinois is being so far away from our families.  I have a very big and very close extended family.  My cousins were over our house all the time and we got together often.  When my brother Peter got married two years ago in the middle of nowhere Canada, about an 8 hour drive from the border, three of my uncles game and brought their families.\n\nLast week I saw one uncle, my uncle Dave, who I haven't seen in over four years.  He'd never met Noah.  I don't even know if he'd met Molly.  So it was a happy reunion.  When it was time to leave - he came up to me in front of my whole family, gave me a big bear hug and prayed for me out loud right there in front of everyone.\n\nI thought - wow, that was over-the-top.  That was extravagant.  But I also knew it was heartfelt and sincere.  \n\nDo you remember the definition we gave this morning for \"prodigal?\"  \n\n> spending money or resources freely and recklessly; wastefully extravagant.\n\nRemember - prodigal means \"spending extravagantly.\"  It's a word about spending.\n\nIn a sense - what my uncle David did was prodigal.  It was extravagant.  It was over the top.\n\nLook at the Father in this story.  Can I tell you something?  What the Father does in this story is \"over the top.\"  It's \"over the top\" in a good way - but it's still \"over the top.\"  In a sense, the father in this story is a prodigal too.  He is spending extravagantly too.\n\nI want you to do something tonight with me that I think will help you to understand:  lets take the father's actions out of this parable and you put them into real life.  Let's imagine that the father in this story is your neighbor.\n\nSo, your neighbors son comes to him and demands his inheritance now.  He says \"I want what is coming to me and I don't want to wait until you are dead.  Give it to me now so I can move as far away from you as possible.\"\n\nWhat would you expect your neighbor to do?  I don't know.  But I wouldn't expect him to mortgage his house and liquidate his stocks. But that is what the father in this story does.  Isn't that a bit extravagant?\n\nOk, so the son who does this to your neighbor goes as far away from the neighbor as possible and just absolutely blows through everything.  He has nothing left.  He takes his part of your neighbors house - that you know your neighbor paid off one month at a time for a lifetime, and he wastes it on partying and drinking.  \n\nHow would you expect your neighbor to treat his son in that case?  I know what I wouldn't expect.  I wouldn't expect for the neighbor to love his son and miss his son and talk about his son all the time.  You know that guy or lady you know who is always bragging about their kids and their grandkids?  You wouldn't expect your neighbor to act like THAT GUY.\n\nBut what if he did?  What if he talked all the time about when his son was coming home?  What would you think?  Wouldn't you think he was a little \"over the top?\"  Wouldn't you think that was a bit extravagant?\n\nOK, so let's say that this kid who ran away and wasted your neighbors money comes home.  And he comes home broke.  He comes home dirty.  Maybe he's got tattoos all over his body and long nasty dreadlocks and piercings.  But your neighbor - as soon as he sees him runs down your road where everybody can see him and he starts crying and gives his nasty, dirty, smelly son a huge hug and starts kissing his face.  In public!  Wouldn't you say that is a bit \"over the top?\"\n\nBut then your neighbor really lost it.  He gives his son his bedroom back.  He forgives him totally.  He gives him access to the family bank account and decks him out in nice new clothes.\n\nYou'd probably think - if that kid ever came back to me I'd tell him where he can go.  But this neighbor - he just keeps loving on this kid.\n\nBut then the neighbor does one more thing that just baffles you.  He throws a big block party.  He invites everyone in the neighborhood.  He hires musicians.  He buys a lot of food.  He spends thousands, just to celebrate his son coming home.  Isn't that \"extravagant?\"  Isn't that \"prodigal?\"\n\nDo you see what I meant when I said that there is more than one prodigal in this story?  The son was prodigal - he wasted his father's money.  But the father, in the eyes of his neighbors, would have been prodigal too.  His actions were \"over the top\" but in the best way imaginable.\n\nAnd that is a parable about our God.  That's the way our God is to us.\n\nSo let me give you four ways that the father in this story was prodigal, and with each one we'll talk about how our God is prodigal too.\n\nThe first thing I want you to see is that the father showed:\n\n## 1. Prodigal Forbearance\n\nWhen the son in this story demanded his inheritance and disrespected the father - the father would have been within his rights to cut off his son.  You can imagine that happening today - some kid goes to his father and calls him names and demands his inheritance now and the father goes to the lawyer the next day and writes his son out of the will.  But that's not what the father did here - he gave his son what he was asking for and watched sadly as his son went away.  But he never attacked his son or acted vengefully toward his son.  \n\nWhat does that tell you about God?\n\nDo you know there are people in every major city in America that openly hate God.  They mock Him every chance they get.  They pay for big billboards that say things like \"there is no God\" and \"God is not real.\"  They write books like \"the God delusion\" and \"God is not great.\"\n\nAnd do you know what I would do if I were God?  I'd wipe em out.  I'd smush them like the insignificant little bugs that they are. I'd go after every single person who shakes their fist in God's face and I'd make sure they got exactly what they deserve?\n\nBut is that what God does?\n\nNo.  God makes the sun to shine of the evil and the good.  God gives these evil rebellious people plenty of time to repent and turn to Him.  \n\nYou heard about the shooting in Orlando last night. A muslim opened fire in a gay night club and killed about 50 people.  It's the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\nHow do you think God views that?  I think a lot of Christians think that that makes God happy.  I don't.  I think God looks at that and He will rightfully judge those people but he would rather they had repented and come home.\n\nGod gives us so much time doesn't He?  He gives us radical, prodigal forbearance.\n\n---\n\nThe second thing we see this father doing is showing:\n\n## 2. Prodigal Love\n\nIn verse 20 it says: \n\n> *\"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him\"*\n\nThe word \"kissed\" there doesn't mean \"to kiss once.\"  This father didn't just give the prodigal son a peck on the cheek.  The word means \"to kiss much, kiss again and again, kiss tenderly.\"\n\nIt wouldn't do disservice to the Bible to read that \"and fell on his neck and kissed him over and over.\"\n\nImagine if you saw a dignified grown man run up to a rough looking twenty-five year old in the middle of walmart and give him a great big hug and just start kissing him over and over.\n\nDo you know what that is?  It's prodigal love.  It's over-the-top love.  \n\nWhen we come to God for salvation we are no less ragged and unlovely as the prodigal son and yet God just loves on us. \n\nA third thing the father showed was:\n\n\n## 3. Prodigal Forgiveness\n\nLet me read you this quote I found in a Spurgeon sermon:\n\n```\n \"Master Trapp says that, if we had read that the father had kicked his prodigal son, we should not have been very much astonished. Well, I should have been very greatly astonished, seeing that the father in the parable was to represent God. But still, his son deserved all the rough treatment that some heartless men might have given; and had the story been that of a selfish human father only, it might have been written that \"as he was coming near, his father ran at him, and kicked him. There are such fathers in the world, who seem as if they cannot forgive. If he had kicked him, it would have been no more than he had deserved. But no, what is written in the Book stands true for all time, and for every sinner,-\"He fell on his neck, and kissed him\"; kissed him eagerly, kissed him much.\"\n```\n\nWhat the son deserved was a beating.  He deserved to be shewed away.  But that's not what He go.  He got forgiveness and restoration.\n\nWhen we came to Jesus for salvation - we deserved God's wrath - we got God's mercy.  \n\nLet me say that again: We deserved God's wrath - we got God's mercy.\n\nDo you know what I think, I think the father didn't need to hear about all the son had done in the far country - I think he forgave him of all of it from the very first moment.  He forgave radically.  Prodigally.\n\nThink about this people - what does that say about our God?  What does it say about the lost world?  God is able to save to the uttermost and He can save the guttermost.  I don't care how filthy, how vile, how wicked people are - they aren't outside of the bounds of God's mercy and God's forgiveness and they can be new creatures in Christ.\n\nThis goes back to one of our assertions this year: \nGod wants to save people.\n\nWhen you go to Denny's and you see the guy with the tattered jeans and the vile t-shirt and the tattoos all over him - try to remember that God wants to save that guy and would welcome him into His arms and forgive him freely.\n\nWhen you go to EIU and you see the two ladies with butch haircuts holding hands, try to remember that God loves those people and desperately wants them to come home to Him and would give them prodigal grace and forgiveness if they do.\n\nSo the father showed, prodigal forbearance, love and forgiveness.  ONe more thing:\n\nThe Father showed:\n\n## 4. Prodigal Grace\n\nLook at verse 22:\n\n> *\"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry\"*\n\nLet me tell you - that's not a small gift. A ring, the best robe, shoes - that was really, really expensive stuff.  But killing a fatted calf and making a party - that was really, really expensive.  This could have costed thousands.\n\nI remember when my sister got married - I saw the cost for the reception.  Yep.  Not looking forward to that.\n\nThis is over-the-top.  It's prodigal. Many would say it's wasteful.\n\nBut I think it's grace.  Grace means \"unmerited favor.\"  It means \"getting something you don't deserve.\"\n\nLet me remind you that God gives us so much that we don't deserve through Jesus Christ.  He showers us with Grace.\n\n",

    "body": "The last three weeks I've been on vacation with my family.  While I was away I read some books, and one of the books I read was a book by a man named Tim Keller on the parable of the prodigal son.  As I was reading this I realized that there was so much about that parable that I have missed and I also realized that it would really help a lot of people to hear it.  So I've decided to preach for three messages on a little series I'm going to call *Prodigals*.\n\nReal quick, no one looking at their phone, I want to ask you something. It's a surprisingly hard question:\n\n> What does the word **prodigal** mean?\n\nAnybody know?\n\nWe've all heard of the story of the prodigal son.  Everybody has heard the word prodigal.\n\nUp until a few weeks ago I would have told you that prodigal means \"rebellious.\"  But that's not what the word means.  If you look it up in the dictionary you'll see that the word **\"Prodigal\"** means\n\n> spending money or resources freely and recklessly; wastefully extravagantt.\n\nSo a prodigal isn't a rebel.  It's a spendthrift.  If I went tomorrow and got a tattoo and a nosering it wouldn't make me a prodigal. I'd be a rebel, but not a prodigal. If I went out tomorrow and spent all of our churches money on a cotton candy machine for VBS, it wouldn't make me a rebel - but I would be a prodigal. So the word \"prodigal\" isn't a word about **submission** - it's a word about **spending**.\n\nI want you to remember that definition, because it's important.  As you'll see, there is more than one prodigal in this story.  That's why I'm calling this series \"prodigals\" not \"prodigal.\"\n\nThis morning, I want us to focus on the prodigal son.  \n\n---\n\nVerse 11 says:\n\n> *\"And he said, A certain man had two sons\"*\n\nHere is what happens in this story.  You have a familiar scene for the time.  You have a wealthy father.  In those days it was customary for the father to give a large inheritance to his children.  It was a big deal.  He would have been a farmer.  Most of his wealth would have been tied up in his land and when he died, he would have broken up all of his wealth into the number of sons he had plus one, and he would have given an equal portion to all of his sons but he would have given his firstborn a double portion.  But none of this would happen until the father died.\n\nSo Jesus says in verse 12\n\n> *\"And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me\"*\n\nThis is where the audience of that time would have said \"whoa - he did what?\"\n\nI had lunch with my papa last week.  He's 86.  Do you know what I didn't bring up during the conversation - any kind of inheritance. We talked about the rotary club and his construction projects and my Nana's health but I never mentioned an inheritance and if he brought it up I would quickly change the subject. Why?  That would be ridiculously rude and disrespectful.  \n\nBut Jesus didn't live in 2016.  Jesus was living in Israel in AD 30.  If it's rude today to ask my Papa about an inheritance - it would have been absolutely unheard of in Jesus day.  What this young son did here was the height of rebellion and disrespect.  He could have walked up to his father and smacked him in the face and it would have been less disrespectful.\n\nWhat most father's would have done would be to disown their son for such an act.  It just wasn't done.  It's obvious the kid had no respect.\n\nBut that's not what the father did.  The father gathered up all that he had and gave his son what he requested.  Think about this for a second - that probably meant selling land.  I'm sure everyone in town heard about it.  His standing in society would drop.  But he gave his son what he asked for.\n\nAnd what does this kid do?  Look at the next verse:\n\n> *And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.* (13)\n\nHe went as far away from his father as he possibly could go and he lived as differently from his father as he possibly could and he spent his father's hard work and dignity on...alcohol, loose women, parties - you name it.\n\nSo what do you think of this younger brother?  He's kind of a scoundrel. Right?  I wouldn't want him working for me.  If I was the father I'd be tempted to say \"good riddance.\"  \n\nNow - I want to stop here and I want to make a couple of points of application:\n\nFirst,\n\n## 1. Like the Prodigal son we are ingrates.\n\nOur heavenly Father has taken care of us, He has loved us, He showers us with His blessings all of the time.\n\nWhen we breath we are breathing His air.  When we eat we are eating His food.  When we feel the warmth of the sunshine that comes from Him.  He has been exceedingly good to all of us.\n\nAnd yet there is this innate thing in all of us that looks at God and says \"that's not good enough.  I want more.\"\n\nI want more than your provision.\nI want more than your care.\nI want more than your will.\n\nWhen you look at the garden of Eden this really comes into picture.  Adam and Eve had EVERYTHING.  They lived in a perfect society.  They had no pain, no sickness, no lack.  Perfect companionship. A place of prominence. The whole world was theirs.  They even had a close relationship with God.  And yet - it wasn't good enough.  They wanted more.\n\nEvery time we choose to sin - it's like that prodigal son is coming out and saying \"get me out of here.\"\n\nThe second point of application this morning is:\n\n## 2. Like the Prodigal son we are rebels.\n\nThis prodigal did more than just show a lack of gratitude for His father.  He totally spurned his father's wishes and wanted nothing to do with his father's plans.  He wanted it his own way. He couldn't wait to get away from His old man and He didn't care if He broke his heart in the process.\n\nHe was a rebel.\n\nSo are we.  God offers us purpose - we go our own way.  God offers us provision - no, we are going to do our own thing.  God offers us pleasures - they aren't good enough.  We spurn the Father's rules and we run from the Father's presence because at our heart we are rebels.\n\nJeremiah 17:9 says:\n\n> *\"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked:who can know it\"*\n\nIsaiah 53:6 says:\n\n> *\"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way...\"*\n\nChurch we are in our hearts wickedly ungrateful and wickedly rebellious.\n\nAnd do you know what we do - we do exactly what the prodigal son does in this story: **We exile ourselves.**\n\nSo, number 3:\n\n## 3. Like the Prodigal son we are exiled.\n\nThe prodigal son goes into a far country.  As far away from the father as he can get and the prodigal son tries to make his life happy and fulfilled with all of the things his father wouldn't let him have.\n\nHe hangs out with the party crowd.  He spends time with loose women.  He's the toast of the town, and most importantly - He is outside of the reach of the father.\n\nWhat a parable for mankind.  The vast majority of the people in this world have exiled themselves from God.  They aren't grateful for all of God's blessings.  They are rebellious against all of God's rules.  They are running as far away from God as they possibly can doing their own thing. Trying to make themselves happy with prestige, with pleasures, with power, with possessions.  \n\nAnd they get it.  They get this fleeting moment of happiness.  They get this fleeting moment of satisfaction.  They enjoy the pleasure.  Remember, there is pleasure in sin for a season.\n\nLook at verse 14:\n\n> *\"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want\"*\n\nThis brings me to my fourth point of application:\n\n## 4. Like the Prodigal son we are unsatisfied.\n\nThe pleasure was real - but it didn't last.  It didn't satisfy.  In fact - it left him poorer.  It left him lonlier.  It left him hungrier.  It left him unsatisfied.\n\nThat's the way the world is.  It promises satisfaction.  It guarantees satisfaction.  Every commercial that we watch is promising it to us.  Every purchase that we make is saying the same thing \"get me and you'll be happy.\"  It promises us satisfaction through romance, through adventure, through leisure, through religion, through sex, through drugs, through alcohol, through partying, through power.  It says to us over and over and over again - just get this and you'll be happy.  Just do this and you'll be satisfied.  Just one more step.  Just one more.\n\nAnd over and over and over again we fall for it.  And over and over and over again we are unsatisfied.\n\nLet me tell you friends - that's the way the world is:\n\n* It promises a party and gives you a pig stye.\n* It promises riches and gives poverty.\n* It promises leisure and gives slavery.\n* It promises companionship and it gives lonliness.\n* It promises satisfaction and it's promises are always, always hollow.\n\nAway from God, people are unsatisfied.  They are conscious of a hole in their life and they are trying anything they can to fill but all they are getting is a momentary buzz, then they have to go on and try something else.\n\nSo, back to our story, this prodigal son has spent everything and now he is in want.  He's lonely, he's hungry.\n\nLook at the next verses: (15-17)\n\n> *\"And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat:and no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger\"*\n\nSo this prodigal son - when he reaches rock bottom - finally starts to think of home.  He finally starts to think of his father.  \n\nI don't know but maybe I think at this moment - he has a different view of all of his father's rules.  Maybe he has a different view of his father's character.  \n\nHe is humbled.  And maybe, just maybe for the first time he starts to regret the way he treated his father.  And he starts longing for home.\n\nThe fifth point isn't going to fit in the blank.  Sorry about that. Here's the fifth point:\n\n## 5. Like the Prodigal son we can come to the end our ourselves.\n\nLook, maybe you decided as a young person \"I don't need this God thing - I'm going to go my own way, I'm going to do my own thing.\" and you took God's provision and GOd's life and you went to a far country.\n\nAnd you aren't satisfied.  Let me tell you - you aren't ever going to be.  Why not do what this son did in this story, why not \"come to yourself.\"  Why not think again about the Father.\n\nThis prodigal son came to himself, he looked at the slop he was eating and remembered that his fathers servants fare better than that.  So he came home.  He humbly went home.\n\nCan I give you a sneak peek - this is so beautiful - the father is waiting for his son.  He could have humiliated him.  He could have sent him away.  He could have made him grovel.  He could have laughed him to scorn.\n\nBut that's not what happens. Look at the verse 20:\n\n> *\"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him\"*\n\nThe father welcomed him and accepted him and made him a part of the family again.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point - really the point of this whole thing:\n\n## 6. Like the Prodigal son we can come home.\n\nLet me tell you something - the Father loves you.  He loves you.  He longs to see you return home.  He longs to see you be a part of His family.\n\nHe wants it so much that he didn't just roast a fatted calf - He sacrificed the Lamb of God.  Jesus died on the cross so that you can be reconciled to the father.  He paid your penalty.  \n\nAnd the Father wants to love you and make you an accepted part of His family.\n\nSo here is my challenge for you this morning: \n\nIf you've never trusted Christ as your savior and made a part of the family of God - why not come home this morning?  That slop you are feeding on will never satisfy - come home.  God will accept you with loving arms.  He will run to you if you just come home to Him.\n\nI would love the opportunity to tell you about how Jesus died for your sins and how you can believe on him for Salvation.  Come home.\n\nMaybe you are here this morning and you are saved - but you've grown away from the father.  To you I say the same thing: come home.  The father will welcome you with open arms.  You know that there is nothing worth having in the far country - you know it will never satisfy - you know how good the Father is.  So come home.  Get right with God.\n\nFor the rest of us here is what I think we should do with this passage:  I think we should remember just how terribly we treated the father, how we took his precious substance and we wasted it.  How we disrespected Him.  How we said in our hearts \"anything but God.\"  And yet, after all of our misdeeds and all of our sin - He welcomed us back and made us a part of His family again and He showers us with his love and grace every day.\n\nWe were the prodigal son, praise God we have such a great and gracious Father.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "Tonight we are going to look at Genesis again and we are looking at Genesis 33. If you remember, Jacob is on his way home, he’s escaped the entanglement of his father-in-law Laban and he is headed towards another conflict - he’s meeting his brother.\n\nJacob, was a little bit of a crook. He was a taker, not a giver. He was willing to deceive his father and deceive his brother to gain a blessing that didn’t belong to him. He was willing to take advantage of his brother’s situation to buy something that he should have respected with a bowl of soup. Everything about Jacob before he left for Padan-aram showed a person who didn’t care at all about anybody but himself.\n\nWhen he left home - he was leaving in part because he had to. Because he knew that as soon as his brother had the opportunity, he was going to kill him.\n\nNow, he’s coming home. He’s a different man. He’s met the grace of God. God has changed him. God has taken him from “Jacob” (Which means supplanter or trickster) to Israel (which means prince with God.) He’s met God at Bethel and seen the ladder of angels going up and down and in the last chapter he wrestled with God through the night. He is a changed man. He walks with the limp of a changed man. He’s right with God, but he still has to face his brother.\n\nLets read chapter 33 together.\n\n”1 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 2 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 3 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 4 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 5 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who [are] those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. 6 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 7 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 8 And he said, What [meanest] thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, [These are] to find grace in the sight of my lord. 9 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. 10 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me. 11 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took [it]. 12 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 13 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children [are] tender, and the flocks and herds with young [are] with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. 14 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. 15 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee [some] of the folk that [are] with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 16 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir. 17 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. 18 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which [is] in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. 19 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 20 And he erected there an altar, and called it Elelohe-Israel.”\n\nThis chapter is a mix of victory and failure. Victory over Essau. Failure to completely obey God by deceiving Essau. Victory in coming back to the promised land. Failure in taking his time doing it and then in going to a half-way spot instead of Bethel. Victory in building an altar, then we’ll see failure in the next chapter.\n\nVictory, failure, victory, failure, victory, failure.\n\nSound familiar? That’s what a lot of our Christian walk looks like sometimes doesn’t it? We’d love to just march on to God, we’d love to be Israel (Prince with God) but we’ve still God our Jacob nature pulling us back.\n\nWe are just going to focus on the Jacob and Essau part tonight. There is a lot of stuff in this chapter beyond that. Adam might preach on it next week or we might lump it in with chapter 34.\n\nThe chapter starts with Jacob anticipating meeting Essau. He looks up and he sees Essau coming for 400 armed men. Trouble. It looks bad.\n\nSo Jacob takes his family and puts them behind him. He orders them in order of importance - the servants with their kids, Leah with her kids and lastly, Rachel with Joseph.\n\nTheir is a failure right there. That favoritism is still there. Jacob was still treating his children and his family unequally. It’s not wonder that later on, Joseph’s brothers wanted to kill him and throw him in a pit.\n\nBut Jacob puts himself out front and he bows himself to Essau 7 times. This is the kind of thing you would do in those days for a king. He is making a big scene of his humility. Calling Essau his Lord. Honoring Essau.\n\nReally, he is kind of giving Essau back what He had stolen from him. He is giving Essau more than the honor Essau deserved as the firstborn. That blessing dictated that his brother would serve him, and here he is serving his brother.\n\nDo you know what he is doing here? He is making restitution. He’s trying to bring about reconciliation. Jacob was right with God, but Jacob still had to get right with his brother. He had to humble himself. He had to back up his words with actions. He had to show, not just say, that he was a different man.\n\nThat’s what I want to preach on mainly tonight is reconciliation. I want to give you three points about reconciliation tonight:\n\n1. The NEED for reconciliation.\nAll along in Jacob’s life - Jacob had been a taker. Essau, more than anyone, was hurt by that. But here, Jacob sends 550 animals. All along, Jacob had wanted the honor for himself, but here, Jacob gives the honor to Essau.\n\nHe’s a different person and he’s trying to make it right.\n\nHow did Essau respond? Look at verse 4. One of the sweetest verses in the Bible:\n\n”And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.”\n\nEssau was overwhelmed by Jacob’s humility and generosity and I think Essau forgave Jacob.\n\nI don’t think that is what He set out to do. But that is what He did.\n\nNow, listen. Let me preach for awhile. It’s super important that you be right with God. But if you are right with God, God wants you to be right with other people too.\n\nRemember when Zacchaeus was saved? Zacchaeus the wee little man. Do you know what Zacchaeus did when he met Jesus? He immediately promised to pay back all the people he’d stolen from. You see, Zacchaeus was right with God and being right with God made him want to be right with his fellow men.\n\nRomans 13:8 says\n\n”Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.”\n\nRomans 12:18 says\n\n”If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.”\n\nGod wants us to strive to be right with people.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, there is someone who you have wronged. Maybe you took something from someone. Maybe you said some nasty stuff to someone that really hurt them. Maybe you lied about someone and hurt them. Maybe you tricked someone. I don’t know. Maybe it was before you were saved.\n\nGod wants you to make it right. God doesn’t want there to be anything between you and someone else if there is something you can do about it.\n\nReconciliation.\n\n2. The COST of reconciliation.\nNow, this passage teaches us a lot about what reconciliation costs. There are three costs of reconciliation we see in this passage:\n\nFirst, the cost is confrontation.\nIn other words, if you want to get right with someone, you have to stop running from them. Stop avoiding them.\n\nJacob had been avoiding Essau for decades. Decades! Jacob was so worried about facing Essau that it drove him to the biggest crisis in his life.\n\nBut Jacob still had to face Essau or there would never be reconciliation.\n\nSo, if there is someone you’ve failed - stop running. Man up and face it. Take steps to make it right.\n\nThe second cost is humility.\nJacob bowed on his face before Essau and treated him like a king. He kept calling him “my Lord” and referring to himself as “your servant.” It was a total act of humility.\n\nDo you know - there aren’t many people who are willing to look you in the eye and say in no uncertain terms “I was wrong. I shouldn’t have done that. Will you forgive me.”\n\nDo you know why? Because it costs something. It costs pride. It takes humility to do that on a level most people just don’t have.\n\nOne of the reasons so many people aren’t right with others is because they cannot bring themselves to say “I was wrong.” They don’t do it because they have too much stinking pride.\n\nListen to me - hear this. That kind of pride isn’t doing you any favors. God isn’t a fan of pride. The Bible repeats this exact statement two times: (James 4:6, 1 Peter 5:5)\n\n”God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.”\n\nYour pride is NOT a good thing. It is not some noble thing. More often than not, it’s our stinking pride that drives a wedge in our relationship with God and it’s our stinking pride that puts us out with other people.\n\nGod says in Proverbs that there are six things he hates, and the very first one is ”a proud look.”\n\nProverbs 29:23 says\n\n”A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.”\n\nMatthew 23:12 says:\n\n”And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.”\n\nAre you picking up a theme?\n\nGod hates pride. God resists pride. Pride is not a good thing. It keeps us from God and it hurts our relationships.\n\nSo if you are going to reconcile with others, it’s going to cost you pride. You are going to have to eat some humble pie.\n\nThe third cost of reconciliation is restitution.\nIn other words, Jacob didn’t just stop running from Essau, He didn’t just humble himself, He took out his checkbook to make old wrongs right.\n\nIn this story - Jacob sends over 550 animals to Essau. That’s a small fortune. That was a significant portion of Jacob’s wealth. The modern equivalent would be selling your house and giving half of the equity away.\n\nThis wasn’t a cheap “I’m sorry.” Jacob had really harmed Essau and he wanted Essau to know He was going to make it right.\n\nEssau even tried to turn it down. He said “I have enough my brother” but Jacob wouldn’t have it. He wanted to make it right and clear the air.\n\nNow, I’m not saying that if you have wronged someone, you have to sell your house to make it right. But I am saying it may cost you something.\n\nIf you slandered someone, you might have to admit that publicly to clear their name (which will hurt yours). If you took something from someone, you should probably give it back. If you burned a bridge, you may have to build it back.\n\nIf you really care about obeying God and making it right, it will cost you. You’ll have to face up, eat some humble pie and maybe even pay up. But you should do it graciously and willingly.\n\nLet me give you one more point about reconciliation...\n\n3. The blessings of reconciliation\nSo, what did Jacob get from this? It cost Jacob dearly - did he gain anything?\n\nI think he did. I think he got at least three things.\n\nFirst, he got a\n\nA clear conscience.\nImagine living for twenty years with the knowledge that you lied to your dad and stole from your brother. Imagine having that on your conscience.\n\nI imagine there were quite a few nights where Jacob lay in bed and the thought of what he had done came back to haunt him. I imagine he felt a lot of shame at times over this.\n\nBut not after this chapter. After this chapter, Jacob could have a clear conscience. He had sought God’s forgiveness and he had done everything in his power to make it right.\n\nListen - if you have wronged someone and you need to make it right - it’s worth it to have a clear conscience.\n\nThe second thing Jacob gained was...\n\nA restored relationship.\nHe got his brother back.\n\nThat’s such a joy. You know, one of my best friends in the whole world is Bob Radank - a missionary to Germany. But Bob and I didn’t talk for years. Years! Because I said something stupid. But when we finally made it right - we got a restored relationship. I got my brother back.\n\nA little humility is a small price to pay for a restored relationship.\n\nSome of you could have your brother, your sister, your father, your mother, your best friend back if you just seek reconciliation.\n\nThe third thing that Jacob got that we get when we seek out reconciliation like this is...\n\nA terrific testimony.\nDo you know the reason Jacob gave for trying to restore what he had taken from Essau. Look at verse 11:\n\n”Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it”\n\nIt was because of the grace of God that Jacob could restore what he had taken.\n\nThere is a New Testament parallel to this too. In Matthew 5 where it talks about turning the other cheek and going the second mile, it also talks about leaving your gift on the altar to be reconciled with your brother. It’s something you do when God is working in you and do you know what? It’s not something we see lost people do very often.\n\nJacob came into this meeting despised - he left this meeting with a testimony with His brother. It cost him. It cost him dearly. But he gained an awful lot too.\n\nLet me wrap this up tonight by urging you - make it right. As I’ve been preaching, if God has been working in your heart about someone you have wronged - make it right.\n\nSome of you need to make a phone call tonight. Some of you need to write a letter. Some of you need to go to someone and say “I blew it, I was so wrong, is there anything I can do to make it up to you.”\n\nMake it right. Reconcile.\n\nLet’s stand for invitation.",

    "body": "# Redeeming the Time (Wednesday PM - 5-16)\n> *”Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.”* (Ephesians 5:16)\n\n> *”Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.”* (Col. 4:5)\n\nRedeem means to “buy up” or “buy back” - the idea here is an idea of investing.  Just like a shrewd businessman buys up local real estate or business opportunities because he has the means to do so, we have this one thing “the time” that we have to use wisely.\n\nThe term “the time” refers to a limited opportunity.  In fact, the greek word that is translated “the time” here is translated “opportunity” in Galatians 6:10.\n\nWe have this one set of time, this opportunity to do something for God and we need to wisely spend it and invest it for His purposes.\n\n## What should we redeem time for?\n\n* Redeem the time for the work of the Lord.\n\n> *”Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.”* (Ephesians 5:17)\n\n* Redeem the time for family.\n\nWe only have “the time”, a limited opportunity to be a witness and an instructor to our family and we need to make the most of it.\n\n> *”[Deu 6:6-8 KJV] 6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.”*\n\n> *”Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”* (Proverbs 22:6)\n\n> *”And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”* (Ephesians 6:4)\n\n* Redeem the time for our walk with God.\n\nMark 1 - Jesus walk with God.\n\n> *”My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.”* (Psalm 5:3)\n\n## What should we redeem time from?\n\n* Redeem the time from excessive sleep.\n\n> *Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:* (Proverbs 6:10 and Proverbs 24:33)\n\n> *”Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.”* (1 Thessalonians 5:6-7)\n\n* Redeem the time from mindless habits.\n\n> *”All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.”* (1 Cor. 6:12)\n\n> *”All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.”* (1 Cor. 10:23)\n\n\n## How can we redeem time?\n\n#### 1. Budget your time.  \n\n(Just as a businessman would budget the money he uses to buy up something.)\n\n> Failure to plan is failure to plan.\n\n#### 2. Prioritize your time.\n\nNot all time is created equal.  Spend your best time on your most important God-given tasks.\n\n#### 3. Guard your time.\n\nBoth your calendar and your checkbook are like a bag with holes.  If you aren’t careful it will all just go out.  You have to be careful you aren’t wasting your time.\n\n#### 4. Invest your time.\n\nDon’t waste your time on wasteful things.  There are lots of things we give our time to that might not cost us anything here and now, but we could invest that time in our own future usefulness.\n\n> “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.  - Abraham Lincoln\n\nLet’s say you spent 30 less minutes every day watching TV and thirty more minutes doing something that might make your more useful for God.  Do you think that would add up?\n\n#### 4. Don’t neglect rest.\n\nEveryone needs some down time.  \nRest can be a part of your preparation.",

    "body": "# Momento Mori\nI have a confession to make, I sometimes like to read young adult books.  Lately, I’ve been reading Lemony Snickets- A Series of Unfortunate Events and in one of those books, the main characters go to a school called Prufrock Academy that his this Latin motto *”Momento Mori.”* - That motto means “remember you will die.” \n\nI think if you had to sum up the last chapter of Ecclesiastes you probably couldn’t do much better than “Momento Mori - Remember you will die.” \n\nFor the last several months we’ve looked at the wisdom of Ecclesiastes - more than almost any other book in the Bible it is a book about having a fulfilling and wonderful life.  It is a book of wisdom, practical tips for how to approach life and to think about the ups and downs that inevitably come our way.  It is a book that teaches us what most people have to learn the hard way - that everything we think is going to satisfy us doesn’t.  \n\nIt tells us to be wise.  It tells us to be bold.  It tells us to be joyful.   Live a full life.  As I said last week - just do something, don’t squander your life away.\n\nBut here in the end of the book, from chapter 11:9 through the end of chapter 12, it sort of changes and makes an impassioned plea to young people.  \n\nLook at chapter 11 verse 9:\n\n> *”Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes.”*\n\nDo you know what Solomon is saying here?  He is saying “follow your heart, follow your dreams.”   Up to this point, His conclusion sounds like every graduation speech ever written - right?  \n\nBut notice the next word.  What it is it?  It is *but.*\n\n> *“But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.”*\n\nSolomon is saying this: **Live a full life, but don’t just live a full life - live a godly life.**\n\nI love to read biographies and lately, I’ve been listening to a lot of mini-biographies on a podcast.  I just love to hear the story of people’s lives.  It’s amazing how much you can cram in a single life.  It’s amazing how much a single person can accomplish.  \n\nYoung person, I think God wants you to live a full life.  I think God wants you to follow your dreams.  I think God wants you to put a full 24 hours into every day and not waste any of it.\n\nFamily, accomplishment, skill, wisdom, art - these are good things to pursue.   But - they aren’t all of it.  And if Solomon teaches us anything in Ecclesiastes it is that we can get all of it.  We can fill our lives to the very brim with all of the gusto this life has to offer and we can still end up empty - we can still miss the big picture.\n\nFollow your heart and your dreams - But -we have to remember that that isn’t all of it.\n\nChapter 12 starts with the word “remember now thy creator” - Remember to put God in the picture.  \n\nRemember to *”Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”*\n\nRemember to *”Present your bodies a living sacrifice.”*\n\nRemember to live for God.\n\nWhy?  Solomon gives us three answers in chapters 11 and 12. The first answer is...\n\n## Remember God because judgement is coming.\n\nChapter 11 verse 9 says *”but know thou, that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.”*\n\nChapter 12, verses 13-14 say:\n\n> *”Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.  For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing whether it be good, or whether it be evil.”*\n\nThe truth is that every one of us is going to stand in either one of two judgments before God.  We will either stand before the Great White Throne as unbelievers and give an account for how we lived and be punished forever, or we will stand before the judgment seat of God and give an account for our Christian life that determines our rewards and placement in heaven.  But every one of us is going to die, and every one of us is going to stand before God and be judged for how we live, and every one of us will regret living for sin and self.\n\nSo remember, judgment is coming.  I used to take these week long summer courses in Pensecola, Florida.  We’d pretty much be in the classroom all day, but we’d have the afternoons and evenings to do what we wanted.  We could go to the beach or a coffee shop or the mall.  We could hang out at the rock wall or bowling alley or water park.  Tons and tons of things to do.  It was awesome.  But do you know what - the end of the week was always coming and at the end of the week there would be tests and there would be papers do and those would determine my final grade.\n\nYou have the freedom to live this life how you want it - but you are going to get graded.  Judgment day is coming.\n\nListen, this is why “live for your heart” by itself is such bad advice.  It’s not that it’s always wrong to follow your heart and your dreams.  Sometimes those dreams are God-given.  What’s wrong is the idea that it is ultimately your heart and your dreams that matter.\n\nFrank Sinatra sang “I did it my way” as if that is all that matters - but you won’t be judged by your way, you’ll be judged by God’s way.  So follow your dreams but Remember God - because judgement is coming.\n\nA second reason why Solomon tells us to remember God in our youth is...\n\n## Remember God because old age is coming.\n\nLook at chapter 12 verses 2-6.  These are a vivid poetic picture of what old age is like.\n\n> *”While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened, nor the clouds return after rain.”*\n\nDo you know what that is saying, it’s saying that when you get old, it’s just problem after problem after problem.  It’s one doctor’s appointment after another.  One funeral after another.  The sun doesn’t stay out for long.\n\nLook at verse 3:\n\n> *”In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves.”*\n\nThis is saying that when you get old, your once strong and healthy arms and legs will get weak, and they’ll tremble, and there will be arthritis, and there will be sagging.\n\nThen it says *”and the grinders cease because they are few”* - you’ll lose your teeth.\n\n*”And those that look out the window will be darkened”* - Your eyesight will get bad.  You’ll have cataracts. \n\nThe next verse says \n\n> *”And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low”*\n\nYour hearing will go away.\n\nThen it says:\n\n> *”And he shall rise up at the voice of the bird”* \n\nYou won’t be able to sleep through the night well and you’ll get up earlier and earlier.\n\n> *”The daughters of music shall be brought low”*\n\nYou’ll lose any interest in listening to music.  It will all just be noise to you.\n\n> *”Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way”*\n\nWith old age comes increased fears.  Fear of falling.  Fear of getting robbed.  Anxiety multiplies.\n\nThen it says...\n\n> *”the almond tree shall flourish”*\n\nYour hair turns white.\n\n> *”The grasshopper shall be a burden”*\n\nYou’ll be weak.\n\n> *”Desire shall fail”* \n\nYou’ll lose almost all of your natural desires.\n\nThat is a pretty poetic explanation of old age.  That’s where all of us are headed.  \n\nI buried my Grampy about a year ago, and the last time I saw him alive, it was so tough, because he was such a strong guy.  Every time I remember shaking his hand, every single time, I wanted to cry because he had such a tough grip.  Even when he was in his seventies and I was in my twenties, I wouldn’t have messed with him,  he was one tough guy.  But that last time I saw him, he was so weak.  He had to be led from one room to another.  You could tell all the gears weren’t clicking, he wasn’t picking everything up.  His handshake wasn’t strong.  It was tough to see.\n\nListen to me - you are going to get old and its’ going to happen a lot sooner than you think it will.  Everyone in here. No one gets a pass.  And when you get old,  you won’t get to do much.  You won’t get to enjoy things that you can enjoy now.  \n\nBut do you know what you definitely will get to do - you’ll get to reflect.  You’ll get to look back on your life and regret all the years you didn’t live for God and you’ll get to experience a lot of the consequences of your youthful foolishness.\n\nIt’s coming.  Tick, tock.  Tick, tock.  The minutes are turning into days and the days into years.  Tick, tock.  It’s coming.  \n\nWhat are you going to regret?  Are you going to be able to say like Paul \n\n> *”I’ve fought a good fight, I’ve finished my course, I’ve kept the faith”* \n\nOr are you going to say in your heart “Why, oh why didn’t I live for God when I had the chance?  Why did I waste my one and only life?”\n\n> Only one life, so soon will pass, only what’s done for Christ will last.\n\nRemember, you will be judged, remember you will get old and lastly.\n\n## Remember God because death is coming.\n\nVerse 5 ends with this statement:\n\n> *”Because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets.”*\n\nThat word “long” there is the Hebrew word Olom and here is how it is translated in the King James:\n* ever - 272 times\n* everlasting 63x\n* old 22x\n* perpetual 22x\n* evermore 15x\n* long 2x\n\nWhen it says “long” home here - it’s referring to eternity.  Man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets.  \n\nWhat this is saying is: You are going to eternity and people are going to have your funeral but you won’t be here.\n\nYou are going to die.\n\nOn January 8, 1956 Pete Fleming, Ed McCully, Roger Youderian, Nate Saint and a guy named Jim Elliot were trying to witness to some Indians in Ecuador, South America when they were killed.  Everyone had told them it was a fools errand, that these indians would never hear the gospel. But Jim Elliot and his friends believed God had called them to reach these unreached people and were determined to go.\n\nIn Jim Elliots journal, they found this quote \n\n> *”He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose.”*\n\nJim Elliot gave all of his young life to serving Jesus.  He died a very young man. Not even thirty.  But today, those Indians are a mostly Christian tribe, even some of the ones who threw spears at Jim Elliot and Nate Saint trusted Christ and lived for him and today, thousands have gone into the mission field because of Nate Saint.\n\nHe lived for eternity.  He’s in his “long” home.\n\nListen, let me just close with a plea.  Follow your heart and live a full life, but Remember your creator.  Live for eternity.  Nothing in this life is going to satisfy.  Nothing in this life is going to make you truly happy.  None of it is going to last.  Old age will come before you know it.  \n\n",

    "body": "One summer when Amanda and I were dating, she came up to New Hampshire for a visit.  I was really excited about this, and I wanted to show here some of my favorite spots in New England.  I was also really excited because I had just gotten a new car; probably my favorite car ever.  It was a 1988 Volvo Station wagon.\n\nLet me tell you about this beauty: It was dark gray, like the color of metal before you paint it.  The interior was dark maroon.  I don’t know what Swedish genius thinks that dark gray and maroon match each other, but that was what it was.  It was this ugly, gray box, but it was really well made. It was actually the fastest car I ever owned.\n\nAnyway, so Amanda comes up, and we decide to take a day trip.  Where can I take her?  I know! I’ll take her to Kennebunkport, Maine.  There is nowhere that is more “New England” than Kennebunkport, Maine.  It’s this picturesque bayside town in Maine that’s just beautiful.  So we hop in my 88 Volvo, and we drive up there.  \n\nAs soon as we get up there, we realize we are way out of our league.  Kennebunkport is one of those towns that only very, very rich people live in.  It’s where the Bush compound is.  Every store is full of very expensive clothes, and every restaurant is very expensive.  It’s the kind of place where 90% of the cars on the side of the road are BMWs or Mercedes.  \n\nBut we enjoyed it.  We walked around.  We got some ice cream.  We went into some gift shops and looked at things we couldn’t afford.  We tried to pretend like we belonged there.\n\nThen it was time to go home, and we got in the old Volvo. I put the key in the ignition and...nothing.  It wouldn’t start.  I found out later the alternator had gone bad.\n\nSo in one of the most humiliating moments of my life, we had to go and beg one of the rich people to jump start our very old beater car so we could drive home.  I felt very, very poor.\n\n---\nOne of the unique things about the book of James is that it deals with the issue of rich people and poor people in a very direct and even brutal way. We are going to see this several places in James: We’ll come again to it in chapter 2 and again in chapter 5.  James deals a LOT with the issue of poor and rich people, but we are going to stick to chapter 1:9-11 tonight.  Let’s read those verses:\n\n\n> *”Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: but the rich in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.”*\n\nTonight we are going to answer these questions: \n\n* How do rich people and poor people relate to each other in the church?\n* How should rich people and poor people think about themselves now that they are Christians?\n\nThis is an important message.  **Let’s pray and we’ll jump right in.**\n\nI’m going to give you four points tonight from these verses, so I hope you are ready to write these things down.  The first point is this:\n\n# 1. The gospel levels the rich and the poor.\nVerse 9 says: \n\n> *”Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: but the rich in that he is made low:”*\n\nNotice that one group is “exalted” or brought up.  One group is “made low” or brought down.   \n\nImagine if you will you have one group—the rich—and they are way up here, looking down on the lowly poor people far below them.  Haughty.  Self-sufficient.  “Uppity.”\n\nAnd then you have the poor, and they are way, way down here.  Lowly.  Humble.  They look up and see the rich, and they think they seem like a million miles away.\n\nAnd something in these verses is making the rich low and the poor lifted up.  Something is leveling them.  I believe what James is getting at here is that the gospel levels the rich and the poor.  The gospel erases that status we see in the world.\n\nI’ve heard many preachers say:\n\n> All ground is level at the foot of the cross.\n\nPaul said in Galatians 3:27-28,\n\n> *”For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.  There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.”* \n\nThere is something about the gospel that unifies us and erases worldly status.  The world is all about status: rich and poor, employee and employer, black and white, in and out, American and Mexican, male and female.  \n\nThe “in” word right now is “identity.”  It’s all about the status you project.  \n\nBut Jesus erases all of that.  All ground is level at the foot of the cross.\n\nNow listen, this doesn’t mean that we throw out all roles and differences and set up some kind of hippy commune.  The Bible makes it clear that there are still certain ways employees should treat their bosses and vice-versa, and that husbands and wives have different roles in a marriage.  But it does mean that none of us are worth more to God than any of the others.  We may have different roles, but none of us are superior.\n\nDo you realize, that in the eyes of Christ, the little six year old is just as important as the pastor?  In the eyes of Christ, the homeless man is just as important as the millionaire businessman.  \n\nWe are brothers and sisters in Christ!  The church should be the one place in the world where these divisions fall away; where the wealthy and the poor, the black and the white, sit together, sing together, take the Lord’s supper together, are unified.\n\nWhy is that?  It’s because my worth isn’t in my position. It isn’t in my bank account balance or my stock portfolio. It isn’t in my friend count on Facebook. My worth as a Christian is found in the gospel of Jesus Christ.  I am a soul for whom Christ died.  I am a part of God’s family.  I am an heir of heaven.  \n\nIt doesn’t matter if I’m shopping at Goodwill or I’m shopping at Gucci.  It doesn’t matter if I’m driving a Tesla or I’m thumbing it.  It doesn’t matter if I live in a country club mansion or if I live in a homeless shelter.  My worth and my identity should be in Jesus Christ.\n\n---\n\nSo the gospel levels us.  That is the first point.  Now, building on that, let’s look at the second thing James was teaching us here:\n\n# 2. The poor need to take pride in their lifted up place in Jesus.\nVerse 9 says, *”let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted.”*\n\nThat word *“rejoice”* is almost always translated either “glory” or “boast” in the New Testament.  What James is saying here is that if you are going to boast or glory or rejoice in anything about yourself as a poor person, let it be in your lifted up place in Jesus.\n\nIf you are poor tonight, you have an exalted place in Jesus.  \n\nJesus’ mother Mary sang a song of praise to God after she found out she was going to be the mother of Jesus.  In it, she said this:\n\n> *”He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree”* (Luke 1:52) \n\nTwice in the Old Testament, in Psalm 113:7-8 and in 1 Samuel 2:8, the Bible says:\n\n> *”He raised up the poor out of the dust and lifted up the needy out of the dung hill: that he may set him with princes even with the princes of the people.”*\n\nGod has this thing about lifting up and exalting poor folks, and if you are in Christ and you are a poor person, you’ve been exalted.  You’ve been “made valuable” by the blood of Jesus:\n\n* You are so valuable that the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, the Man to whom every world leader and every billionaire will someday bow, died for you.\n* You are so valuable that you are a child and an heir of the one who owns all creation.\n* You are so valuable that you have been *”made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.”* (Col. 1:12)\n* You are so valuable that your father owns the cattle on a thousand hills and the wealth in every mine. (Psalm 50)\n* You are so valuable that Jesus is preparing you a mansion in the Palace of heaven. (John 14)\n* You are so valuable that you are someday going to walk on streets of gold near pearly gates. (Rev 21:21)\n\nYou have an exalted place in Jesus.  So listen, poor person, don’t look down on yourself.  Don’t let others look down on you.  You may have a hard and humble time here, but you are going to inherit the earth.  You possess everything in Christ.\n\nYou are exalted.  Identify in that.\n\nJames 2:5 sums it up pretty well:\n\n> *”Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs. Of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?”*\n\nThe poor are exalted. Take pride in that.\n\nThat is point number 3...\n\n---\n\nBut what about the rich?  What should they take pride in?  What should they identify or glory in?  \n\n# 3. The rich need to take pride in their humble identity in Jesus.\nAgain, verse 9 says:\n\n> *”Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: but the rich in that he is made low.”*\n\nJust as the poor are to glory or rejoice in their exaltation in Christ, the rich are to glory and rejoice in their humility in Christ.\n\nLet me put it another way: **The same gospel that lifts us up, also puts us down.**  Listen: If I am anything in Christ, it’s not because of me.  It’s not because of **my** accomplishments.  It’s not because of **my** status.  I have nothing to bring to Jesus.  My righteousness is as filthy rags.\n\nJesus said in Matthew 5, *”Blessed are the poor in Spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”*. When we come to Jesus, we have to come empty-handed.    We can’t come to Jesus and say to Him, “Respect me! Look at my accomplishments! Look at my riches! Look at me!”  No, not matter how rich you are, you come to Christ by saying, “I am nothing and I can do nothing except what Jesus has done for me.”\n\nI think that’s why Jesus said that it’s easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to be saved. (Matthew 19:24) \n\nIt’s very hard for rich people to drop their pride and their accomplishments, and humbly accept Jesus.\n\nSo this verse teaches us that the gospel lifts us up while also putting us down.  We are lifted up in Christ but put down in our own earthly accomplishments.\n\nOne commentator explained this verse this way:\n\n> To his financial troubles, the poor brother says, “But how rich am I!” And to his earthly glories, the rich brother says, “But what a wretch I am.”\n\nAnother person said it this way: \n\n> As the despised poor learns self-respect, so the proud rich learns self-abasement.\n\nListen, rich man: Don’t be proud of your riches.  Be humble and grateful for your position in Jesus Christ.  \n\nSo this passage teaches us that the gospel levels us; that poor people can take pride in their exalted position in Christ; and that rich people can take pride in their humble position in Christ, but there is one more thing James teaches us in these three verses:\n\n---\n\nLook again at verses 9-11:\n\n\n> *”Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: but the rich in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.  For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.”*\n\nIn Israel, they have these hot, dry winds that can rise up out of the desert with no warning and blow hot, dry air on their flowering grass and dry it up in an instant.  It’s here, and then poof! It’s gone. It’s worthless.\n\nPoof.  It’s gone.  Poof.  It’s worthless.\n\nJames says, *”so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.”*\n\nThe last thing we need to see here is...\n\n# 4. The rich need to understand that their lifestyle is temporary and could be lost in a moment.\n\nJames is saying to the rich: Don’t put too much stock in your stuff.  Don’t put too much stock in your bank account.  Don’t put too much stock in your nice clothes and your nice cars.  Don’t put too much stock in your beautiful house. Because—one—it could be gone in an instant, and—two—it will not be yours for eternity.\n\nDo you realize there are powerful forces who spend billions and billions of dollars doing nothing more than convincing you that you need more stuff, nicer clothes, a bigger house, a fancier vacation.  The tv shows you watch aren’t paid for by your cable subscription, they are paid for by Honda and Lexus and Ashley Home Furniture.  The magazines you read aren’t paid for by the $5 you spend on them, they are paid for them by Dos Equis and Mercedes and Perry Ellis.  \n\nThe world is trying to convince us that the true way to happiness is through worldly status and the only way to get worldly status is to get the “in” things.  \n\nBut James reminds us that worldly things don’t last.  They are here today, gone tomorrow.\n\nGrowing up in Boston, one of my favorite basketball players was Antoine Walker.  Antoine Walker made over $110 million dollars when he played for the Celtics.  He bought Bentleys and BMWs, he never wore the same designer suit twice.  Whatever was left over, he invested in Chicago real estate.\n\nThen the stock market crashed and Antoine Walker lost everything.  He had to sell his NBA championship ring.  He doesn’t own a car.  He shares a house in Chicago with five family members.  \n\nThat strong hot wind just came through and poof.  It was gone.  It was all gone.\n\nThings don’t last.  Worldly status doesn’t last.  It’s here today, gone tomorrow.  So James tells us to focus on the status that does last, our status in Christ, and hold onto the rest with light fingers.\n\n---\nSo what are we to do?  Let me give you some points of application and I’ll close tonight:\n\n1. Don’t be a poor Christian or a rich Christian. Be a Christian who happens to be poor or a Christian who happens to be rich. **In other words, find your identity in Christ, not in your social status.**  \n2. Don’t live for possessions. Live for Christ.\n3. If you do have possessions, invest them in eternity, not in earthly shows of status.\n4. Don’t let your poor position or your rich position come between you and a brother and sister in Christ.\n\n**Let’s stand for invitation and prayer.**\n",

    "body": "# James 3:14-16 - Shibboleths For Fake Wisdom\nThere is this story in Judges 12 where there was a bit of civil war in Israel betweeen the Gileadites and the Ephraimites.  The Ephraimites had their pride hurt because the Gilieadites fought some bad guys without them, and it turned into a full-out war between these two groups.  At one point, the Gileadites had the Ephraimites surrounded and were going to wipe them out when the Ephraimites had the idea of just pretending to be Gilieadites to save their own skin.\n\nSo to keep this from happening, the Gileadites came up with an ingenious solution.  They would stop everyone and make them say the word “shibboleth.”  Apparently, people from Ephraim had a funny accent and couldn’t say the word right, no matter how hard they tried, so it was easy for the people from Gilead to figure out who was faking and wipe them out.\n\nA shibboleth then is something that makes it obvious when someone is faking.  In our text tonight, we are going to look at two attitudes that are a shibboleth for false wisdom.  What our text is saying is that if these two attitudes exist in someone, then they don’t have spiritual wisdom.  You can mark it down, and you can close the case. These two things absolutely don’t go with “wisdom from above.” They are the polar opposites of spiritual wisdom.\n\nLet’s read the all of James 3:13-18 again, but tonight we are just going to be focusing on verses 14-16:\n\n> *”13 Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work. 17 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, [and] easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.”*\n\nRemember: This text is about finding out who is wise or finding out who we should be listening to; not by listening to what they say, but by watching their attitude and their manner of life. In verse 13, we talked about their works and their lifestyle.  We talked about how they can’t be a jerk, but they have to be meek.\n\nThese next verses make the very strong point that there are two things that absolutely never go with spiritual wisdom: “envy” and “strife”.  It repeats these two things twice: “Envy and strife.”\n\nThe problem is that it’s kind of hard to understand what James means here without taking a deeper look at these two words, so that is what we are going to do tonight; we are going to do a little word study.\n\nLet’s start with the first word:\n\n## Envy\n\nEnvy comes from the greek word “Zalos,” which is sometimes translated “zeal,” but most of the time it refers to jealousy or envy.\n\nThe dictionary defines envy as:  \n\n> a feeling of discontented or resentful longing aroused by someone else’s possessions, qualities, or luck.\n\nEnvy happens when we look at someone else—we look at what they have, whether it’s their money, their talents, their looks, or their family—and then we look at what we have and we get jealous.  We get angry with God because we think it’s unfair.\n\nWhen I was in college, I had this roommate who was a few years younger than I was.  He looked like a model.  In fact, he was the spitting image of Ashton Kutcher.  He drove a brand new sports car.  He sang really well.  He wore clothes from Brooks Brothers and Allen Edmunds.  He was good at sports.  His grandfather was a famous preacher.  Because they closed the dorm where I was staying in the middle of the semester, they put me in his room when I was a senior, and he became my room leader.\n\nMan, I got to tell you: That burned me up.  I hated that guy.  He seemed to have it all.  It seemed like God was just stacking it up on his side of the table. \n\nThat’s envy. Do you ever feel envy?  Do you ever drive through the country club and think, “Why them?”  Do you ever see other people going on fancy vacations and think, “Why can’t I do that?”\n\nListen: If you don’t think preachers get envious, you are wrong.  One of the biggest temptations in ministry is to look at some guy pastoring a bigger church who seems to be doing better than you and envying what he has.\n\nAnd you might think, “Well, that’s not a big deal.  That’s human nature.”  But the Bible actually makes a very big deal out of envy.\n\nLet’s look at a couple of verses.  Turn with me to Romans 13:13:\n\n> *”Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.”*\n\nNotice what the Bible does there.  It gives us three groups of sins put together:\n\n* Rioting and drunkenness - That’s the party, drug filled lifestyle.\n* Chambering and wantonness - That’s a sexually immoral lifestyle.\nAnd then…\n* Strife and envying.\n\nWhat? It’s easy to look down on the party dude, the drunk, the junkie, and the loose lady.  That’s easy, but God puts envy in the same category.\n\nLook at another passage with me.  Turn to Galatians 5:20-21:\n\n> *”Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”*\n\nEnvy is on the same list as witchcraft and murder.  It’s kind of a big deal to God.\n\nLet’s look at the second word:\n\n## Strife\n\nThis word “strife” is actually pretty rare.  It is the Greek word *Erithea.*\n\nIt’s actually a political word.  It’s a word that means “running for office or electioneering.”  \n\nThayer’s Lexicon defines it like this:\n\n> a courting distinction, a desire to put oneself forward, a partisan and factious spirit which does not disdain low arts; partisanship, factiousness\"\n\nOriginally, the word meant “spinning for hire,” and then the word came to mean “freelancing.” Finally, it came to talk about self-seeking political ambition.\n\nMost of the time we see this word in the Bible, it’s translated as “contentious,”  but it is a selfish contentiousness.  \n\nI’m going into all of this because it helps us understand what James is talking about here.  It’s not just saying people who fight and are contentious. It’s telling us a bit about why they are contentious. They are contentious because they are ambitious and because they want to win.\n\nStrife is when we start seeing people as competitors rather than co-laborers.  Strife comes into our heart when we start to think about winning over others.  \n\nSo envy and strife—jealousy and competitiveness—is an ugly duo.\n\nLook at our text again:\n\n> *”13 Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work.”*\n\nThese things are shibboleths.  These two attitudes NEVER go with spiritual wisdom.  They NEVER go with true godliness.  If you see them, you run because they are a bad deal.\n\nYou might think, “Pastor, you are making an awful big deal about envy,” but envy IS a big deal.\n\n* It was envy that caused Cain to kill Abel.\n* It was envy that caused Sarah to send away Hagar.\n* It was envy that caused Joseph to be sold into slavery.\n* Moses dealt with envy many times and uprisings of Jews were killed because of envy.\n* Envy caused Saul to go mad and try to kill David.\n\nAnd let’s put it where we live: Envy ruins churches.  You don’t get far in Acts until you have one group in the church complaining that the other group has it better.  In 1 Corinthians, you saw that there was an issue of envy between the rich and the poor, as well as between those who taught and those who didn’t.\n\nEnvy still ruins churches.  Why does she get the accolades?  Why does he get to teach?  Why do they get so many blessings when they are hardly faithful to church?  Why do they get a new car when we are struggling to get by?  Why does there family seem so perfect and we are struggling?\n\nIt’s ugly, folks.\n\nEnvy ruins families.  There are lots and lots of people who can barely stand their brother or their sister because of envy.  They were momma’s favorite.  They got money and we didn’t.  They are too big for their britches.\n\nI know of someone I’m close to who cannot ever speak about his only brother without expressing jealousy and envy.  They don’t go to a lot of family get-togethers.  It tears the family apart.\n\nParents can get envious of their children, and children can be envious of their parents.  Husbands can be envious of their spouses and vice-versa.\n\nEnvy and strife are incredibly destructive forces.  They are like a cancer in every relationship where they live.  They suck the joy out of life.  They cause us to hate those we should love and to be sad when we should be happy.  \n\nBut the main thing I want you to understand about envy and strife is that they are the polar opposites of how we are supposed to live as Christians.  That’s the idea in this text.  They don’t go with true spirituality.  They are like toothpaste and orange juice, like nuts and gum, or like drinking and driving.  They just don’t go together.\n\nSo how are we supposed to live?  We are going to look at that next Sunday night in James, but let’s look at what another book says about it.  Turn to Philippians 2.\n\n> *”[Phl 2:1-7 KJV] 1 If [there be] therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, [being] of one accord, of one mind. 3 [Let] nothing [be done] through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. 4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. 5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:”*",

It is appropriate to be grateful for our country.\n\nEphesians 5:20\n\n> *”Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;”*\n\n### We can be grateful for our freedoms\n* We have the freedom to worship God.\n* We have the freedom to preach and share the gospel.\n* We have the freedom to elect our own officials.\n* We have the freedom to criticize our own government.\n* We have the freedom to educate our children as we see fit.\n### We can be grateful for our heritage\n* We were founded on Christian values\n* We are the first major country to promote the idea of the separation of church and state and complete freedom of religion.\n* We have been a sending ground for missionaries and the gospel all over the world.\n\n## 2. It is appropriate to pray for our country.\n\n1 Timothy 2:1-4\n\n> *”1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men; 2 For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 3 For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.”*\n\n* We need to pray for our nation’s leaders.\n* We need to pray for our nation’s souls.\n\n## 3. It is appropriate for us to be good citizens.\n\nWhy?\n\n* Because God ordained government.\n\nRomans 13:1\n\n> *”1 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. 2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.”*\n\n* Because we need to render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s\n\nMark 12:17\n\n> *”And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marvelled at him.”*\n\n* Because even pilgrims and strangers should be good citizens\n\nJeremiah 29:4-7\n\n> *”4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon; 5 Build ye houses, and dwell [in them]; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; 6 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. 7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.”*\n\n\n# So is it appropriate to be patriotic in church?\n\nYES.  Absolutely.  \n\n* If patriotism means being grateful for this great country, then yes!\n* If patriotism means praying for this great country, then yes!\n* If patriotism means being a good citizen of this country, then yes!\n\nFly the flag.  Shoot off fireworks.  Sing patriotic songs!  Yes.\n\nBut we have to remember that there are three things that are sometimes mistaken as patriotism that are not appropriate for us as Christians:\n\n1. It’s NOT appropriate to worship our country instead of the God who gave us our country.\n2. It’s NOT appropriate to be Americans first, Christians second.  We are pilgrims and strangers.\n3. It’s NOT appropriate for us as Christians to misapply verses and promises given to Israel as if they were given to  America.",

    "body": "# Mark 4:35-41 - Sleep, Storms, & Our Sovereign Savior\n\nA couple of years ago, Adam and I were over in Lane Acres, less than a mile away, passing out invitations and tracts.  I don’t think I’ll ever forget this.  Suddenly, the sky opened up in the nastiest storm I’ve ever seen.  It came out of nowhere.  It was beautiful and sunny one minute, and the next minute trees were snapping and shingles were flying off of roofs.  I ran back to the car as fast as I could to go pick up Adam, and before we could even get out of Lane Acres, there were trees down all over the road.  There were power lines down on the highway.  I think it took about thirty minutes to find a way home that wasn’t covered in downed trees.\n\nStorms are scary.  \n\nLast year, in the middle of the night, our old church in Tennessee, a beautiful church that had about six beautiful buildings on this nice country property, was completely destroyed in a few minutes by a tornado.  Buildings were leveled; roofs were torn off; tree branches everywhere; decades of work and care destroyed in an instant.\n\nWe go through life with this illusion of control, and all of a sudden, nature just opens up and reminds us that in an instant our beautiful home could be rubble.  That tree we think would be there forever snaps like a toothpick.\n\nOur story today is one of the most famous in the whole Bible.  It’s so famous that it’s inspired a whole slew of hymns:\n\n* With Christ in the vessel I can smile at the storm\n* Till the storm passes by\n* Master the tempest is raging\n* I’ve anchored my soul in the haven or rest\n* A shelter in the time of storm\n* We have an anchor that keeps he soul\n* When peace like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll, whatever my lot thou hast taught me to say, it is well with my soul.\n* Be still my soul the waves and winds shall know, His voice who ruled them while He dwelt below\n\nThat’s just a few.  I did a search on the internet and found about 150 storm-themed hymns.  \n\nThis morning, we are going to read the text that inspired all of those songs.  It’s a super familiar story, but sometimes we need to be reminded of those familiar things.\n\nLet’s read Mark 4:35-41.\n\n> *”(35) And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. (36) And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. (37) And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. (38) And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? (39) And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. (40) And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? (41) And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? (Mar 4:35-41 KJV)”*  \n\n\nI’m calling my message this morning, “Sleep, Storms and Our Sovereign Savior.” If you haven’t figured it out yet, those will be the three main points of my outline this morning.\n\nLet’s start with...\n\n# 1. Sleep\nFor the last several weeks, we’ve been talking about all of the things Jesus was teaching and doing.  We talked about how there were people everywhere and He had to teach from a boat.  We talked about how He was so busy that He couldn’t even eat.\n\nWell, the text says that Jesus is in this boat and the evening comes. It’s the end of the day, and Jesus says to His disciples, “Let’s just go on over to the other side.”\n\nThe Sea of Galilee is actually a lake.  It’s shaped like a fiddle.  Jesus and His disciples are at the northwestern edge of the lake, and the next story happens in the very southeastern part of this lake, so when Jesus said, “Let’s go over to the other side,” they literally are going as far across this lake as possible.  From one corner to the opposite side, it’s about 13 miles.\n\nAnd they are doing this spontaneously at night.  They aren’t getting supplies ready.  They were already in the boat, using it as a platform, so they just pick up the anchor and set sail for the other part of the lake.\n\nAnd the Bible says in verse 38 that Jesus was in the back of the ship, asleep on a pillow.  Jesus was exhausted, so He slept.\n\nMy old pastor, Pastor Scallions, used to tell me from time to time as kind of a joke that sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is take a nap.  \n\nSometimes your body needs sleep, and Jesus had a human body. He had human emotions, and Jesus needed sleep. Jesus was exhausted.\n\nThis boat wouldn’t have been that big; maybe 25 feet long—so about from this pulpit to the back wall there—and maybe seven feet wide. It was shallow almost like a canoe, and Jesus is curled up in the back sleeping soundly on a pillow.\n\nJesus isn’t anti-rest.  In fact, Jesus said in Matthew 11:29:\n\n> *”Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”* \n\nJesus came to give us rest, but I want to point out something. Jesus’ rest came **while** He was serving God.  His rest came while He was working.\n\nWhen Jesus said, “Take my yoke upon you,” that meant work.  The yoke is what you put on farm animals to get them to pull.  \n\nI think the best sleep and the best rest is the rest that comes while we are doing something for God.\n\nLet me put it another way: I think the best rest comes when we get in on what Jesus is doing—when we find what God is doing in this world and we jump in.  He’s already in the yoke—He’s already doing something—so we just need to jump into the other side.  When we are actively doing what Jesus is doing, we don’t just find rest for our bodies; we find rest for our souls.\n\nWe can rest because we are working, but we can also rest because we realize that the work doesn’t ultimately depend on us.  It’s God’s work, and He’s far more capable than we will ever be.\n\nSo Jesus slept.  He needed sleep.  He was physically exhausted.  Remember that the next time you are physically exhausted, when you feel like you just can’t go another step.  We have such a Savior who *”can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities;”*  We have a Savior who was *”in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.”* (Hebrews 4:15)\n\nSo that’s the first thing: Sleep.  The second point I want to talk about this morning is…\n\n# 2. Storms\nVerses 37-38 say:\n\n> *” (37) And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. (38) And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? ”*\n\nYou wouldn’t think that a storm on a lake would be that big of a deal, but you would be wrong.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, there was a tour group out on a lake down in Branson, Missouri, and a sudden storm popped up out of nowhere and capsized that boat, killing 17 people.\n\nOne of the things I remember about my grandfather that was really weird is that he would never eat fish.  That’s weird when you live in Boston and seafood is such a big deal.  It’s also weird when you consider that he grew up in a little fishing town on Lake Michigan and his father was a lighthouse keeper. \n\nSo I asked about it one time. It turns out that my grandfather’s only brother, my great uncle, was a professional fisherman on Lake Michigan.  He was working the lake one day when a storm whipped up out of nowhere and killed their whole crew.  They never found his body.  He was 28.  That’s why Grandpa didn’t eat fish.\n\nStorms on a lake are a very big deal, and storms in the Sea of Galilee were especially bad.  The Sea of Galilee is the second lowest lake in the world.  It’s way below sea level, but it’s surrounded by mountains.  Those mountains act like tunnels for cold air that hit the warm air on the low lake, and it creates super storms out of nowhere.  \n\nAnd remember: The disciples knew this lake.  They spent their whole lives on this lake.  They were used to storms, but this one was something else.  This one was some kind of super storm.  I imagine waves like mountains tossing this little ship around, its shallow hull is filling up with water quickly.  These seasoned fisherman know the end is near.  They’re giving up.\n\nAnd they look back in the back of the boat and there is Jesus. HE’S STILL SLEEPING!  First, how is that even possible?  Second, how is that even possible?\n\nSo now the disciples are terrified and annoyed.  How can you sleep through this?  So they wake Him up and say, *“Master, carest thou not that we perish?”*  \n\nI kind of empathize with these guys here.  \n\nBut I want you to understand a few things about storms:\n\n## First, this storm came while the disciples were obeying Jesus.\n\nJesus said, “Go over to the other side right away,” and that’s exactly what these disciples did.  They obeyed.  They pushed off.  They didn’t protest.  They didn’t try to get supplies.  They just did what Jesus told them to do.\n\n* And yet they were fighting for their lives.\n* And yet it seemed like it was all about to be over.\n\nThere is this really dumb idea that some people teach that if you just follow Jesus, then you’ll never have to deal with any problems—that you’ll never have any storms.  **Understand something: THE BIBLE DOES NOT TEACH THAT.**\n\nThe Bible does not teach that if you just have enough faith, you can have “your best life now” and “make every day a Friday.”  Nope.  The Bible makes it very clear that sometimes when you are following Jesus, He leads you right into storms.\n\n* Sometimes, in the middle of obeying Jesus, you get sick.\n* Sometimes, in the middle of obeying Jesus, you lose someone.\n* Sometimes, in the middle of obeying Jesus, one of your kids breaks your heart.\n* Sometimes, in the middle of obeying Jesus, you get into financial difficulties.\n* Sometimes, in the middle of obeying Jesus, truly terrible and terrifying things happen to you.\n\nJust because you are going through a storm does not mean that you are out of God’s will, that you are a disobedient Christian, or that you just don’t have enough faith.  Sometimes the storm is God’s will.\n\nSo that begs the question: Why?  Why does God allow us to go through storms?\n\nOne of the guys on this boat, Peter, had something to say about that in 1 Peter 1:7:\n\n> *”That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:”*\n\nYou go through trials to try your faith.  That’s a word that comes from smithing.  The smith would take the metal and heat it up so he could get the impurities out.  \n\nSo the second thing we learn about storms here is…\n\n## Second, God leads us into storms to strengthen our faith.\n\nI know very little about weight lifting.  To answer the t-shirts I’ve been seeing around: “No, I don’t even lift, bro.”  But I do know this: I know that if you don’t stress your muscles, they never get stronger.  That soreness you feel after a hard workout, that means something is working, and it only comes when you push yourself to the limit.\n\nYour faith is like a muscle, and if you don’t ever use it, it’s not ever going to get stronger.  If it isn’t stressed from time to time, it’s never going to grow.  Sometimes God has to lead us into the storm so we have to trust Him to get us out of the storm.  He does this to stress our faith so that we learn to trust Him.\n\nSometimes we imagine life without storms and life without stress, but we need to realize that no stress means no strength, and no storms means no learning to rely on our Savior.  \n\nHere is another example: How many of you know someone whose parents sheltered them from every trial their entire life? They provided everything they wanted.  They were always helicoptering close by to swoop in and save the day.  Then the kid grew up, and they had no strength.  They can’t pay their bills. They can’t keep a job.  They are allergic to responsibility.  A lot of times, they end up living off of Mom and Dad for the rest of their life.\n \nWe chafe at the hard stuff; at the trials; at the difficulty, but it’s the hard stuff, the trials, the difficulty that gives us strength.  That builds our character.\n\nI’ll give you two examples of famous people tied to our area:\n\nAbraham Lincoln was known as this wise and magnanimous guy who seemed unbreakable despite going through some of the hardest stuff any president had to endure, but Lincoln wasn’t just born that way.  Lincoln’s strength came from growing up in abject poverty; losing his mother; then having to quit school; then having to educate himself; then going bankrupt and losing a business; then losing the love of his life as a young man; then marrying a woman who proved to be insane; then losing one of his children.\n\nIn other words, Lincoln was strong because he had to be strong.\n\nAnother example would be Ulysses S. Grant. We have the Grant flagpole at the library and the illustrious U.S. Grant Motel. Grant graduated from West Point and served briefly in the army, but there was no major war, so he was sent back into civilian life. For decades, the man lived hand to mouth.  His family and he barely survived.  I mean they had it hard.  When the Civil War came around, he had suffered and been humbled for so long, he seemed like he’d go through anything. Unlike his peers, he didn’t seem to care at all about advancement and prestige.  \n\nBut his strength came at a cost.  Listen, folks: Strength always comes at a cost.  Whether it’s muscular strength or strength of character, it costs something.  You have to endure hardship.  And spiritual strength is the same way. God uses the storms—God uses the hardship and the stress—to build up our faith muscles.\n\nSo we’ve talked about sleep.  We’ve talked about storms.\n\nLet’s talk last about... \n\n# 3. Our Sovereign Savior\nSo they wake Jesus up in the middle of the storm, and Jesus is annoyed.  He turns around and commands the storm:\n\n> *”And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.”*\n\nIf you’ve ever spent any time on the water, you know that waves take a while to settle down.  I was blessed as a kid to have a lake house to go to with my extended family, and we did a lot of water-skiing and tubing.  I remember my stepdad would take great joy in getting the water as rough and wavy as he possibly could, and afterwards, it took a while for the waves to settle down.  The water would still be choppy for a bit.\n\nAfter a huge storm, it’s the same way.  Even after the storm stops, the waves still stay choppy for several hours.   They have to settle themselves down.  But here, Jesus just says to the wind and the waves, “Peace, be still,” and it’s suddenly deathly quiet. The waves are suddenly calm.  The lake flattens itself out immediately.\n\nOnly God can do that.  And these disciples, they are terrified.  They were scared by the power of the storm, but they are now more terrified by the power of the Savior.  \n\nVerse 41 says: \n\n> *”And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”*\n\n\nPsalm 89:8-9 says:\n\n> *”O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.”*\n\nThink about what the disciples learned about Jesus in just a short time.  They learned that He was fully human—that He needed sleep and rest like the rest of us.  And they learned that He was fully God—able to quiet the winds and the waves and make the storm go away in a single word.\n\nThey learned this in a way that no theology textbook or sermon could ever teach them, and they would never forget it.  This wasn’t their last storm.  Every one of these disciples would face hardship again and again, but they went through those storms knowing that the Person who was with them understood what they were going through and could make the storm go away in a single command.\n\nOne of the last things Jesus said on this earth was:\n\n> *”and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world”*. (Matthew 28:20)\n\nSome of you know what it’s like to go through storms with Jesus.  You know He’s going to bring you through.  You know He’s going to help you.  You know He cares.  And you know this, not because of a sermon, but because you’ve already been in storms with Jesus, and He’s used those storms to build up your faith and strengthen you.\n\nLet me wrap this up with three admonitions for you:\n\n1. Don’t shirk the storms.  Don’t avoid them.  Don’t hate them and despise them.  God uses the storms of life to help you grow.  \n2. If you are going through a storm today, remember who is in the boat with you.  Trust in Jesus.  He knows what you are going through, and He knows how to make the storm go away, but if you are following Jesus, He might also know that you need this storm. Just trust Him.\n3. Woe to the person who has to face the storms of life without Christ.  If you’ve never accepted Jesus, put your faith and trust in Him.",

    "body": "# James 4:11-12\nTake your Bibles with me and turn to James 4.  I’ve got to say, before we even get into this, that this is one area I know I need to work on. The Bible is a two-edged sword, and this one cuts me A LOT. \n\nWe are just going to look at two verses tonight, so this will probably be a shorter message.  Look with me at James 4:11-12:\n\n> *”Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?”* (James 4:11-12)\n\nA big part of the book of James are these little commands.  They are all tied together.  They are tied to the idea of humbling ourselves and not being worldly.  This one is simple: *“Speak not evil one of another.”*\n\nEverything else in these verses supports this simple command.  Don’t speak evil against your brothers and sisters.  \n\nI’m going to give you two simple points tonight: The what and the why—what is commanded here and the reasons James gives us for this command.\n\nLet’s pray and we’ll look at that.\n\nLet’s start with…\n\n## The What: \n\nWhat is James command here: *”Speak not evil one of another.”* Simply, it means…\n\n> Don’t criticize or judge.\n\nBarclay said that this sin is... \n\n> the sin of those who meet in corners and gather in little groups and pass on confidential information which destroy the good name of those who are not there to defend themselves.\n\nIt’s gossiping.  It’s criticizing.  It’s putting people down with your mouth.\n\n* It’s “I can’t believe what so and so did.”\n* It’s “Did you see what she had in her shopping cart?”\n* It’s “I heard that so-and-so is letting his kids do this. Can you believe a Christian would do such a thing?”\n* It’s “Brother so-and-so wouldn’t need so much help if he quit his bad habits.”\n\nBe honest with yourself.  You do this.  I do this.  This is one of those sins we just sort of wink at. It’s one of those commands we pretend isn’t even in the Bible.  We might even spiritualize it and think we are doing some kind of Christian service or doing our part to keep the church pure.  But God says, *”Speak not evil one of another.”* Don’t judge; don’t criticize. \n\nNow let’s just take a step back here and ask, “Why is this even bad?”  \n\nI mean, there has to be *some* judgment, right?  It’s impossible to follow many of the commands of the Bible without some judgment.\n\nFor instance, how do you not walk in the counsel of the ungodly, stand in the way of sinners, sit in the seat of the scornful if you don’t first make a judgment about who is a sinner, scornful or ungodly?\n\nAnd there has to be some criticism.  The Bible says we are to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.  It says we are to mark those who cause divisions and offenses contrary to the faith and avoid them.  That requires some criticism and judgement.\n\nSo what does this even mean?\n\nWe are going to talk about that, but I think the main difference is in why you are criticizing and judging.  If you are criticizing and judging in humility—almost reluctantly as a part of your obedience to Christ—then that is a good thing.  But the vast majority of our criticism and judgment isn’t that way. Most of the time we do it to make ourselves feel good, to win social points, or just because we like putting other people down.  That’s bad.\n\nSo the what is don’t judge and criticize.  Let’s look at…\n\n## The Whys:\n\nJames gives two reasons why it’s bad for us to judge and criticize.  The first reason is…\n\n### 1. When you judge and criticize, you are breaking God’s law.\n\nJames was saying that the God’s law forbids you from slandering and criticizing, so if you are slandering and criticizing your brother in Christ, you aren’t just breaking the law; you are putting yourself above the law and saying, “If I had written the law, I’d write this part different.”\n\nWhere does the law say this?  The Old Testament does command against putting down your brother in Leviticus 19:16: \n\n> *”Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.”* (Leviticus 19:16)\n\nBut it was Jesus who really took this and made it much clearer in the New Testament.  Jesus said in Matthew 7:1-2,\n\n> *”Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.”*\n\nListen: God’s Word says don’t be a critic.  God’s Word says don’t be a judge.  When you become a judge or a critic—when you make it your mission to find out what is wrong with everyone else—you are breaking God’s law.\n\n### 2. When you judge and criticize, you are taking God’s role. \n\nThe second argument that James gives for why we shouldn’t be judgmental critics is found in verse 12:\n\n> *”There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?”*\n\nI think what James is saying here is that it’s not our job to judge.  That’s God’s job.  It’s not our job to criticize; that’s God’s job.\n\nIf you have multiple kids, you’ve seen this.  One of our kids takes it upon themselves to be the little parent.  They go to their brother or sister and say, “Don’t do that.  You aren’t supposed to do that.  Mom!  Noah’s eating the carpet again,” or something like that.  \n\nIt never goes well because it’s not her job to be the parent.  That’s our job.  \n\nThis is really important for us to understand.  We are God’s servants.  We report to God.  It’s not our job to be a busybody and criticize what other servants are doing.\n\nRomans 14:4 says…\n\n> *“Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.”* (Romans 14:4)\n\nLook at that question: Who art thou? In other words: Who are you?  Who do you think you are?  When did that become your job?  The answer is it isn’t your job, and you are out of place.\n\nOne of my favorite passages is in John 21 when Jesus appears to the twelve and asks Peter, “Lovest thou me? Feed my sheep.”  Remember that passage?\n\nWell, at the end, Peter asks Jesus about John.  Peter said basically, “Well, what about John?”  Do you remember Jesus’ answer?  Jesus said, “What is that to thee?  Follow thou me.”  Jesus basically said, “Peter, mind your own business.  Focus on Peter, not on John.  You’ve got enough to worry about right there.”\n\nListen: God wants us to mind our own business and leave the judging of others up to Him.\n\nSometimes people will come up to me and say, “Did you hear what Maranatha is doing?  Or did you hear what Pastor so-and-so is doing?”  And I want to say, “It’s none of my business. Our church has its own problems.  Let’s focus on obeying God and let God deal with His other servants how He sees fit.”\n\nIt’s none of my business.\n\nBut also, I’m not God and I don’t know everything perfectly.  I don’t know people’s intentions.  I don’t know their heart.  I don’t know every in and out and every circumstance.\n\nNow let me come right down to it and tell you what I think the crux of this is.  The reason why it’s wrong to criticize and judge has nothing to do with the truth.  Sometimes the judgment or the criticism is true.  It isn’t wrong because it’s not loving, although it might be.  **The main problem with being a critic and being a judge is that it’s not humble.**\n\nWhen we become a critic and when we become a judge, we are putting ourself in the place of God.  That’s a very, very arrogant place to be.\n\nRemember that James 4 is all about humility.  Criticism and judging are the exact opposite of what we read last week about humbling yourself under the mighty hand of God and mourning over our own sin.  Those two things don’t go together. If I think I’m a wretch, I’m really not going to be too hard on my brother.  If I’m conscious of my own sin, I really am going to have no time to nitpick my brothers and sisters in Christ.  That’s the attitude that we should have.  \n\nSo when you judge and criticize, you are breaking God’s law, and when you judge and criticize, you are taking God’s place.  \n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn closing, let me give you some practical questions to ask before you become critical.  When you start to feel the urge to criticize, just go through this little checklist.\n\n1. Do I have sin in my own heart?  Do I have a log sticking out of my own eye I need to take care of before I pick this splinter out of my brother’s?\n2. Do I know 100% of the circumstances behind my brother’s actions?\n3. Can I see my brother or sister’s heart?  Can I see their intentions and motivations?\n4. Is what they are doing any of my business?  \n\nI think it was Lee Roberson who used to say, “It takes no size to criticize.”  That’s a good motto.  Let’s be bigger than that.  Let’s be smaller than that.  Let’s be truly humble and ask God’s help with this sin.",

    "body": "I love to read biographies.  I read a lot of them.  I'm reading one right now about a missionary to the middle east.  Do you know what I hate though?  I hate reading a biography that makes a person out to be faultless.  I've read many biographies where the author's intent wasn't to tell the story of someone's life - it was to make that person some kind of larger-than-life saint.  The fancy word for that is \"hagiography.\"  I hate hagiography.\n\nDo you know why? \n\nBecause no one is really like that.  No.  One.\n \nIf you actually knew Abraham Lincoln or George Washington or Amelia Earhart  or Charles Spurgeon or whoever - you might think they were kind of a jerk. Of maybe they smelled funny.  Or maybe they couldn't match their clothes.  Or maybe they had weird habits.  Because no one is perfect.\n\nOne of the things I love about the Bible is that it doesn't give us hagiography.  When it tells us about men, it portrays them as men.  Not as giants.  Not as statues of perfection.  Men.  It tells us about David's adultery, his parental failures, and his failed marriages.  It tells us about Moses' temper and his rough relationship with his wife.  It tells us about Esther's reluctance to rush into the throne room for her people.  It tells us about Peter's denial of Christ and when Paul had to confront him because he was being hypocritical.  It gives us people lumps and all.\n\nOur story this morning is a great reminder of that.  Truthfully, if I were writing this - I don't know that I would give this detail - but I didn't write it, God did, and He did it for our learning.\n\nLet's read Acts 15:36-41 with me:\n\n> *\"[Act 15:36-41 KJV] 36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, [and see] how they do. 37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark. 38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; 40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.\"*\n\nThis story is pretty simple, it doesn't take a lot of explanation.  So far, Paul and Barnabas - or really Barnabas and Paul - have been going around starting churches and evangelizing the lost.  They are the dynamic duo. The first missionaries.\n\nPaul is the super-educated persecutor turned super-missionary.\nBarnabas, the Levite, is the encouraging, godly guy willing to do anything for the cause of Christ.\n\nThey seem like they are inseperable.  Like they are going to last forever.  Then Acts 15 happens and we are like \"I didn't see that coming.\"\n\nIt's like batman and robin or the lone ranger and tonto have a breakup.  No one expects it.  It's like Kevin Durant going to Golden State.  No one sees it coming and it isn't going to be a pretty split.\n\nHere is what happened:  \n\nThe decided it was time to go back and visit the churches they had started. \n\nGreat.  All good.  No problem.  Let's do it.\n\nSo Barnabas says, let me go get my cousin John Mark and we'll bring him along again.\n\nAnd Paul says \"No.  Way.  Don't you remember what happened last time.  He abandoned us.  I'm not bringing that flake with us again.  What if we get in a tight spot, is he going to abandon us again.  We are better off without him.\"\n\nAnd Barnabas says \"I really think we should bring him\" \n\nAnd Paul says \"No.  Not going to happen.\"\n\nAnd they Bible says:\n\n> *\"And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other:\"*\n\nThey blew up and then they broke up.\n\nPaul picked a new partner - Silas and Barnabas took John Mark and they split up and went different ways and just like that it was over.\n\nNow, this is in the Bible.  It's in there for a reason.  What does God want us to learn from it?  Let me give you six lessons.\n\nThe first one is this:\n\n## 1. Saved people aren't perfect. (even apostles) \n\nIsn't it kind of shocking to see this about the apostle Paul?  We love the apostle Paul.  He is a great Christian man.  Maybe the greatest Christian man in the bible.  \n\nAnd then Barnabas.  Barnabas was such an encourager.  Remember, it was Barnabas who went and got Paul when no one else at Jerusalem trusted him.  When everyone thought he was a spy.  Barnabas was the one who vouched for Paul.  He was the encourager.  The nice guy.\n\nYet, it turns out, both of these guys seem pretty hard headed here.  You would think that after all they had gone through they should be able to work something out - to make some kind of compromise - but no.  They didn't.  They blew up.\n\nAnd to me, this is just a reminder that **the best of men are men at best**.  Nobody's perfect.  Everyone has their lumps.  Everybody has their quirks.\n\nYou here people talk sometimes about \"the perfect church\" - there are no perfect churches because their are no perfect people.  If this church was perfect it stopped being perfect when you got here. I could say that about anybody in here.\n\nYou here ladies sometime talk about finding \"the perfect man\" - mr. right.  But are they Miss right? If they are honest they'd say no.  Nobodies perfect.  \n\nNow, listen - that's no excuse for us to not TRY to be.  That's not to be an excuse.  But it should be our expecation.  David said in Psalm 39:4\n\n> *\"LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.\"*\n\nWe are all frail.  All flesh.  All imperfect.\n\nA second lesson we can learn from this is...\n\n## 2. Conflicts happen. (even with godly people)\n\nMy pastor and boss back in Tennessee served the same church for over 40 years. He would always joke that he had started 8 churches in the Athens, TN area - none on purpose.  Conflicts.\n\nI've met people here.  In Mattoon. Baptists.  Christians.  Who are still mad about stuff that happened 40 years ago.  Conflicts.\n\nConflicts happen.  Conflicts will always happen.  It's part of being a human being.  Anytime you have two people with two wills and you put them together in one place you are going to have conflict.\n\nNow, there are certainly things we can do to avoid conflicts - but we'll never make them go away altogether.\n\nThe third lesson I think we can take from this might surprise you:\n\n## 3. Sometimes both people are right. (even though they can't see it at the time.)\n\nYou see.  Think this through with me.  \n\nLook at it from Paul's perspective: They are doing great work.  It's dangerous.  They are being thrown in jail and risking their life and visiting hostile people.  John Mark has already abandoned them.  It's just not wise to take him with them again.\n\nThat makes sense - right?\n\nNow, look at it from Barnabas' perspective: John Mark is a godly young man. He wants a second chance.  Maybe he needs an encouragement.  He knows what to expect.  He's not going to do it again so easily.  He already knows the ropes.  Aren't we supposed to be \"forgiving one another and forbearing one another?\"  Wasn't it Paul that said that?\n\nThat makes total sense too.\n\nI think they were both right.  Both had good points.\n\nChurch, one of the wisest things we can learn is that when their is a conflict - it's not a zero sum game.  It's not a win-lose thing.  It's not always \"one of us has to be right.\"  Sometimes, both of us can be right and some yielding has to happen. \n\n`<rabbit-trail>`\nCan I veer off subject for a second and say something I think is related and very important:\n\nWe are totally losing the ability to have any kind of conversation in our country.  We've totally stopped trying to compromise with people who don't agree with us. We've totally lost the ability to empathize with others at all and to think about where they are coming from.\n\nLook - we've had a rough week in this country.  The two black men who were shot by police on camera.   We don't know the details yet - but it looks bad. Then the dozen police officers who were shot in Dallas.  We've had the major party nominee absolutely excoriated by the head of the FBI.  We've had mass shootings.  \n\nI remember watching a documentary about the end of the 60s: The race riots, the riots at the conventions, the assassinations - and I thought \"Man, I'm sure glad I wasn't there.\"  Well, we are there now church.  We are there now.\n\nAnd do you know what we need?  Do you know what we desperately need.  We need people who can see others through God's eyes.  Not as democrats or republicans or as blacks or whites, but as people Jesus died for.  As fellow fallen human beings who are right about somethings and wrong about somethings.  As people who need a savior.\n\nSorry.  Rabbit trail over. `</rabbit-trail>`\n\nBack to the point -conflicts are going to happen. Sometimes there isn't a right party.\n\nLet's move on to the fourth point - and from here on out it is a lot more encouraging:\n\n## 4. God is sovereign (Even in conflicts.)\n\nDo you know what happened here?  Two good people had a breakup.\n\nDo you know what else happened in this story?  God took one missionary team and turned it into two.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, this conflict was God's way of moving these people apart so that He could do more with them seperately.\n\nYou know, when an eagle is teaching it's babies to fly - it will take their nest, which is really comfortable, and start turning up the twigs and sticks so that it's uncomfortable to prod them out.  Some people need to do that to their grown children.  \n\nI think God is big enough that maybe He was twisiting some twigs in the Paul-Barnabas nest so that He could better use them both elsewhere.  \n\nLook, you might have to deal with conflicts today and they might not be pleasant but someday you'll be able to look back and sing \"my father planned it all.\"  God is sovereign.  Just trust Him.\n\nThe fifth lesson from this story is just as encouraging:\n \n## 5. When we make mistakes, God isn't finished with us (Even if other people are.)\n\nSo the man at the middle of this story was Barnabas' cousin - John Mark.  John Mark abandoned Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey.  He blew it.  Paul didn't want to go back out with him.\n\nBut this isn't the last we hear about John Mark.  Not by a long shot.  God wasn't done with John Mark yet.  In fact, John Mark had the privilege of penning one of the gospels.  The book of Mark.\n\nLook, sometimes in life we make mistakes.  Big mistakes.  We blow it.  But that doesn't mean God is done with us, it doesn't mean that God can't use us.\n\nIt was after Moses killed an Egyptian man in anger that God used him to write most of the Old Testament and lead his people out of Egypt.  It was after Jacob deceived his father and father in law that God gave him the honor of being called \"Israel.\"  It was after Peter blew it at Christ's crucifixion that he became the leader of the apostles.\n\nPeople might be ready to cast you off - but that doesn't mean God is done with you.\n\nOne more lesson and we'll be done, and I think I've saved the best for last:\n\n## 6. God can put it back together (even after a blowup.)\n\nTo get the coolest part of this whole story you have to turn to the last book that the apostle Paul wrote - when he was very near to dying. Turn to 2 Timothy with me and look at 4:11.  Notice what Paul says here:\n\n> *\"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee:for he is profitable to me for the ministry\"*\n\nHere, Paul is at the end of his ministry.  He's in a jail cell.  He's facing death.  Most people have abandoned him.  Who does he call for?  Who does he ask for by name?\n\nYes. John Mark.\n\nNow listen, how about you?  Is there anybody who you've had a conflict with and the relationship is strained?  It doesn't have to be. God's big enough to fix it.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAn old preacher once said\n\n> To dwell above with saints I love, that will be glory.  To dwell below with saints I know - now that's another story.\n\nWe laugh at that - but the truth is conflict is just a part of it.  We are commanded to forgive each other, to forbear each each other, to love each other and help each other - but sometimes we just can't stand each other.\n\nChurch, we just have to trust God to heal those strained relationships.\n\nI heard a preacher say once\n\n> God isn't please with broken relationships.\n\nThat's stuck out to me for a long time.\n\nMaybe you've let someone down.  You've been a John Mark.  You've never apologized.  Let me tell you God can still use you.  He's not finished with you yet.  God can repair that relationship too.  Just trust Him.\n\nMaybe there is someone out there you need to forgive.  Maybe there is someone out there you need to ask forgiveness to.  Take care of it today.\n\nLet me close by saying one more thing.  All of us let someone down - all of us deliberately let down God.  We broke that relationship.  And He loved us so much that He sent His only son to die on the cross for our wrongs, and He wants to forgive us and restore that relationship.  Trust Him today.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.\n",

    "body": "# [Conflicted] Mark 1:16-20\nOur text this morning is going to be Mark 1:16-20.  Today we are going to talk about the calling of the disciples and about what it means to be a disciple and follower of Jesus.\n\nLet’s turn there and read that passage together before we get started:\n\n> *”16 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers. 17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. 18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him. 19 And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets. 20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.”*\n\nHow do you answer a call?  \n\nWhen Americans answer the phone, most of us just say, \"Hello.\" It’s different kn other countries.\n\n- Germans answer a ringing phone with their last name.\n- In Denmark, the Danes will answer with both their first and last names.\n- Russians say, \"I’m listening.\"\n- The curious French say, \"Hello, who’s on the line?\"\n- Italians greet callers with \"Ready\" upon which the caller demands, \"Who's speaking?\"\n- The Spanish give the command, \"Speak!\"\n- The Chinese proclaim, \"Hey, hey, who are you?\"\n\nIn this passage we are going to see how Peter, Andrew, James and John answered the call to be a disciple of Jesus.\n\nRemember, Mark skips over a lot of content.  It’s the “Cliff notes” gospel.  This passage makes it seem like this is the first time Jesus has met Andrew and SImon and James and John.  But they’ve actually been following Jesus off and on for about a year at this point, and have seen Jesus preform several miracles already.\n\nBut in this passage, Jesus calls them to follow Him full time.  He’s been dropping hints for a year.  He’s told them to follow Him before.  He’s shared his heart with them and they’ve seen enough of Him to know, that Jesus is the real deal.  And in this passage Jesus makes it official and these men are going to step out by faith and follow Jesus for the rest of their lives.\n\nWhat does it mean to be “called?”  Sometimes you’ll hear preachers talk about “the call to preach” or missionaries talk about “ the call to the mission field.”  I think that’s a real thing.  Believe me, I’m not a preacher because I had nothing else to do.  The last thing I imagined myself being as a kid was a preacher.  I ran pretty hard from that.  I just felt the leading of the Lord very clearly in my life that this was his plan for me and I could either be a Jonah or be a preacher.\n\nBut I think there is a sense that all Christians are “called”.  Whatever God calls you to *do*, Jesus calls you to *Himself*.  He calls you to a life of following Him.  He calls you to be a witness to others and advance His mission.\nThis passage is as good as any for us to talk about what that means.\n\nI’m going to give your four main points this morning.  We are going to talk about the nature of the called, the nature of the caller, the nature of the call and the future of the called.  I know that’s a mouthful, but we’ll understand a little better as we get into it.  \n\n**First, let’s pray.**\n\nThe first thing I want us to look at in this passage is...\n\n## 1. The nature of the called.\n\nIn other words, who were these people?  Peter and Andrew, James and John.  Who were these guys?\n\nVerse 16 says that they were casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishers.\n\nIt’s easy to think of Peter, Andrew, James and John as the local Galilee anglers club.  There was a group of old guys who like to fish down in Tennessee who met nearly every morning at Hardees.  They called themselves “the liars club.”  It’s easy to think that these guys were that kind of fisherman or fishermen in the Bass Pro Shops, outdoor channel kind of way.  That it was their hobby.\n\nBut they were actually fishermen in the “deadliest catch” kind of way.  This was their living.  This was their business.\n\nAnd it was kind of a big deal.  It was a big enough deal for them to support families.  We know Peter had a wife and a house.  We know they owned multiple boats.  We know they had a bunch of hired employees.  This was their business.   \n\nHistory tells us that the fish from the Sea of Galilee would be salted and shipped all around the known world at that time.  It was such a big business that some of the cities around Galilee were actually named for the fish trade.  Bethsaida mean “house of fish.”  This was a big business.  And these guys were in on it.\n\nSo...\n\n### A. They were simple businessmen.\n\nThey knew their trade.  They knew how to take care of themselves.  They were probably very good at it and they probably made a comfortable living at it.   \n\nIt was the family business, they learned it from their dad who probably learned it from his dad who could have learned it from his.  There was some pride there.\n\nBut they were more than just businessmen...\n\n### B. They were believers.\n\nLong before Peter, Andrew, James and John met Jesus they were followers of John the Baptist.  Actually, the first place we see these guys isn’t on a lake in Galilee, in the North of Israel, it’s down in Judea where they were listening to John the Baptist.  \n\nIn John 1, Andrew and probably the apostle John were listening to John the Baptist preach when John the Baptist said \n\n> *“Behold the lamb of God that take the away the sins of the world.”*  \n\n And it seems like they said to themselves, *if that’s the lamb of God, why am I listening to this guy?*  So they started following Jesus.\n\nThen Andrew got his brother Peter in on it too and Jesus said to them “follow me” so they did for awhile.  Off and on for about a year at this point.\n\nThese weren’t just random fishermen that Jesus met for the first time, they were believers and...\n\n### C. They were friends and followers of Jesus.\n\nSo what did they know about Jesus?  My second point this morning is...\n\n## 2. The nature of the caller.\n\nThese guys had been with Jesus for a year now and they had seen some things about Him...\n\n### A. They had seen his power.\n\nThey were there at the wedding at Cana when Jesus turned the water into wine.  They were there, also at Cana, when Jesus just spoke a word and healed the nobleman’s son.  They knew that this was no normal man, He was someone who had power from God.\n\nAlso...\n\n### B. They had heard his message.\n\nThey were “flies on the wall” when Jesus said to Nicodemus *“Ye must be born again”* and *“As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth on me shall not perish.”*. They heard, after the fact, about how he offered the woman at the well *living water.*\n\nIn John 6 (which is after this point) Peter a bunch of Jesus’ followers were deserting him and Peter said this:\n\n> *”Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.”* (John 6:68) \n\nRemember folks, Jesus’ message was far more important than Jesus’ miracles.  The purpose of the miracles was to back up the message.  We might not see miracles like the disciples did, but we still can say like Peter did “Where else are we going to go?  You have the words of eternal life.”\n\nThey had seen Jesus power, they had heard Jesus message and...\n\n### C. They had seen his heart.\n\nIn John 4, Jesus insisted on traveling through Samaria so he could talk to the woman at the well.  It might have made perfect sense to the disciples that he would talk to Nicodemus, and upstanding Jew.  But this woman was a Samaritan. She was despised.  And she was an immoral Samaritan.\n\nBut after Jesus witnessed to this woman, He said to his disciples:\n\n> *”My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.  Say not ye, there are yet four months and then cometh harvest?  Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes to the fields; for they are white already unto harvest.”*\n\nJesus had a heart for souls.  He saw the multitudes as people who needed to hear his message and be saved.\n\nSo who were they?  They were a bunch of fishermen, ordinary guys who had followed John.  But they knew Jesus, and they heard his message and they saw his heart and his power.\n\nSo I have to ask you - have you met Jesus?  \n* Have you heard and believed His message?\n* Would you say like Peter “Where can we go, you have the words of life?”\n* Have you seen His power?\n* Have you seen His heart for people?\n\nNow, let’s get back to the passage in Mark and get to the meat of this.  My third point is...\n\n## 3. The nature of the call.\n\nJesus comes to these guys while they are fishing and He says in verse 17 *”Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.”*\n\nWhat was Jesus calling them to?\n\nFirst...\n\n### A. It was a call to follow.\n\nJesus was saying “come ye after me” or in other gospels “follow me.”  \n\nThat’s a simple message isn’t it?  That’s not complicated.  Just stop what you are doing and follow me.  I’ll give you instructions later.  Just walk where I’m leading.  Step where I’m stepping.  Do what I’m doing.  \n\nDon’t worry about the end game.  Don’t worry about tomorrow.  Just follow me.  Day by day.  Step by step.\n\nAt it’s simplest, that’s what being a Christian is all about.  Just following Jesus.  Getting as close to Him as you can and going where He is leading.  Everyone knows how to play “follow the leader” and that is what God asks us to do - just follow Jesus.  Come after Him.\n\nEverything else is secondary.  Everything else is incidental.  For us it’s about being with Jesus.\n\nI have a friend from college who worked as an assistant pastor for a very talented preacher on the east coast.  That pastor got called to a huge church in California and do you know what my friend did, he went with him.  After a couple of years out there this guy got called to an even bigger church in the Carolinas and guess what, my friend followed him there.  Either this guy has some really good blackmail material or there is something special about him.\n\nWe ought to be that attached to Jesus side.  Following Him through our life like a puppy follows his master.\n\n```\n?\nIf Jesus goes with me I’ll go...anywhere.\nIt’s heaven for me, wherever I be\nIf He is there.\nI count it a privilege here,\nHis cross to bear\nIf Jesus goes with me I’ll go \nAnywhere\n```\n\nThat’s the heart of it.  It’s just following Jesus.  Being with Him.\n\nIt’s a call to follow.  Also,...\n\n### B. It was a call to leave.\n\nVerse 18 says:\n\n> *”And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.”*\n\nThis was a huge step of faith for these guys.  They were fishermen.  That’s how they brought home the bacon.  (But they were Jews and fisherman so maybe that’s how they brought home the bass.)   It was a family business.  Their families could have been doing that for hundreds of years.  It was what they knew.\n\nAnd they left it all behind to follow Jesus.  They were leaving their old way of life behind.  They were leaving what they knew behind, they were stepping out by faith.\n\nThe call to follow Jesus may include that for you.  He may ask you to leave the nets and the fish behind and do something new you know nothing about.  He may ask you to give up security, to give up comfort, to leave your familiar place to serve and follow Him.\n\nFor some of us, following Jesus means leaving your home and traveling across the country or across the world to serve Jesus.  \n\nBut it’s always a call to leave. \n\nIt’s always a call to leave your old life behind and take on the new adventure of following Jesus.  It’s a call to leave the world and the world’s system. \n\nMake no mistake about it, if you answer the call of Jesus, you are going to leave some things behind.\n\nSo it’s a call to follow, a call to leave, thirdly...\n\n### C. It was a call to learn.\n\nMany times Peter, Andrew, James and John were called “disciples.”\n\nThe word “disciple” means “pupil” or “learner.”  In Bible times you’d attach yourself to a teacher and follow Him around and be mentored by Him.    Almost like an apprenticeship.\n\nFollowing Jesus means learning from Jesus.  It means we don’t know everything.  We aren’t the teachers, we are the learners and He is always teaching us.  It’s a lifetime of learning.\n\nIt means day by day sitting at Jesus’ feet.  \n\nI was thinking the other day about the time I spent as an assistant pastor in Tennessee, and the most valuable thing for me, far more valuable than college, was watching my pastor be a pastor and talk to him about it every day.  I had responsibilities that were a little too big for me, and he helped me through them.  He mentored me.\n\nThat’s a lot like what a life of being dedicated to Jesus is like.  He’s going to help you and speak to you every day through His word.  He’s going to provide you resources and help.  He’s going to build you up.\n\nA call to follow, a call to leave, a call to learn and lastly...\n\n### D. It was a call to work.\n\nRemember, when Jesus said *”Come after me and I will make you to become fishers of men.”*. He wasn’t talking to Bass Pro Shops fishermen, He was talking to Deadliest Catch fishermen.  Fishing for them meant work.  Hard, grueling, demanding, exhausting work.\n\nFollowing Jesus always includes a job.  God has a job for you to do.  Jesus’ great mission was to *”seek and to save that which was lost”* and if you are going to follow Jesus He is going to get you in on that job too.\n\nIf I was going to follow a baker all day I’d probably plan on decorating some cakes.  If I was going to follow a farmer I’d probably plan on plowing some ground before it was over.  If I was going to follow a carpenter I’d be learning to use a tape measure and carry some boards.  If you are going to follow someone who is seeking lost souls - then you are going to be seeking lost souls too.  You’ll be fishing for men.  You’ll be sowing the seed of the gospel.  You’ll be giving out the medicine of scripture.\n\nThat’s part of it.\n\nDo you realize, Christian, that God has a job for you to do.  There are no extra soldiers in the Lord’s army.  Every member of God’s family has a job to do. Just like every body part has a job, every member of a church should be working for Jesus.\n\nSo have you answered God’s call on your life?  Are you following Jesus?  Is He using you?  Are you learning at His feet and picking up His work?  Have you left your old life behind to follow Jesus?\n\nOr are you still on the fringe?  Are you still on the sideline?  Are you still a spectator?  I believe Jesus wants some people to enter the life of faith and follow Him this morning.  You’ll have to leave some things behind, you’ll be learning new things, you’ll have a job to do.  \n\nYou see, Christianity was never supposed to be a spectator sport.  God wants everyone to get off the stands and get into the game.  He’s calling everyone to “follow me.”\n\nHas He called you?  Have you answered?\n\nI want you to hang onto that and real quick I want to give you the last point...\n\n## 4. The future of the called.\n\nYou see, we know the end of the story.  We get to see what God did with these people who left their nets and followed Jesus.  Peter, Andrew, James and John.\n\n* Peter went on to be the leader of the early church, he preached to thousands, he wrote books of scripture.  He died a martyrs death.\n* Andrew, history tells us, became a missionary and preached all over Asia Minor and even all the way up to the border of Russia.  He too died for Jesus.\n* James was a leader in the early church and was one of the first martyrs for Christ.\n* John lived a long life of following Jesus and travelled all over the known world and was used by God to write five books of the New Testament.\n\nThey were fishers in a small town in the middle of nowhere.  But we know there names.\n\nThey were fishermen with no cars, trains or airplanes, but they travelled the world.\n\nThey were just fishermen, unlearned men, but they wrote books of scripture that people are still quoting millenia later.\n\nThey were just fishermen, but they got to see God do miracles in and through them.\n\nThey were just fishermen, but they got to follow Jesus.\n\nC.T. Stud had it all.  He was a millionaire.  He was a world renowned professional athlete.  He was living the life.  Then he met Jesus and felt God was calling him into the mission field.  He was being called.  He sat down one day with his checkbook and gave away everything, then picked up his family and moved to China.\n\nHe labored in China, in the Middle East and then in Africa and he died a humble missionary.  But that was over 100 years ago, and I know his name and even if I didn’t hundreds and thousands of people are in heaven today because he answered God’s call.  And you can read about his adventures on the mission field.  To him it wasn’t much of a trade.\n\nWilliam Borden was heir to the Borden milk fortune. One of the richest young men in America.  But God got a hold of his heart. He started visiting homeless shelters here in America while he was in college.  He wrote in the front of his Bible two words “No retreats.”  \n\nHe finished Bible college and felt like God was calling him to the mission field, but he had this huge fortune to deal with.  He gave it all away.  He opened his Bible again and wrote two more words “No reserves.”\n\nHe went to Egypt to start ministering there and to learn Arabic.  God was using Him.  But he tragically got sick there and died as a very young man.  When they found his Bible, he had written two more words underneath “No Regrets.”\n\nChurch, there is no life more meaningful or more exciting than the life of the called.  It’s not much of a trade really.  \n\nWhether God is calling you to be a preacher or a missionary or just a faithful church member, it’s an exciting life.  It’s a life of faith.  It’s a life of following Him.\n\nHave you answered the call?  What does God want you to do?  Are you walking by faith?  Are you fishing for men?  Are you following Jesus?\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

One of my favorite stories was about Benjamin Franklin.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was just a teenager.  He was cocky.  He was coming home from his first time away from Boston. He had a little money and a good paying job in Philadelphia, and it went straight to his head.\n\nBenjamin Franklin had crossed rhetorical swords with a Puritan pastor named Cotton Mather many times.  For whatever reason, Benjamin Franklin decided to pay Cotton Mather a visit on his trip home, so he was walking and talking to Cotton Mather, who was telling him that he was getting a big head.\n\nSuddenly, Cotton Mather said to Benjamin Franklin, “Stoop!  Stoop!”  Franklin thought he was telling him to be humble, but actually he wasn’t looking where he was going and walked right into a low hanging beam. Ouch.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Ben Franklin would learn the lesson that you can avoid a lot of pain if you don’t hold your head too high.\n\nTonight we are going to look quickly at Daniel 4.  It’s interesting because the key character in this chapter isn’t Daniel.  Daniel isn’t even the one talking.  The key character and the narrator of this chapter is King Nebuchadnezzar.  \n\nNebuchadnezzar got a big head and God had to teach teach him to “Stoop! Stoop!”  God had to teach Him to be humble.\n\nLet’s read the chapter:\n\n> *”1 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. 3 How great [are] his signs! and how mighty [are] his wonders! his kingdom [is] an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion [is] from generation to generation. 4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in my palace: 5 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me. 6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise [men] of Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream. 7 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof. 8 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name [was] Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom [is] the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, [saying], 9 O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods [is] in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. 10 Thus [were] the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof [was] great. 11 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: 12 The leaves thereof [were] fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it [was] meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. 13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; 14 He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches: 15 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and [let] his portion [be] with the beasts in the grass of the earth: 16 Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. 17 This matter [is] by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.”*\n\nNebuchadnezzar had another dream.  I know you are probably thinking, “This guy has a lot of dreams.  What does he eat before bed?”  I don’t know, but this time, Nebuchadnezzar remembers his dream.  He goes through the whole thing all over.  He calls the wise men, but they can’t figure it out.  He calls in Daniel, and he tells him the dream. If you read the chapter, Daniel is troubled.\n\nYou see, this isn’t a good dream for Nebuchadnezzar.  \n\nNebuchadnezzar had got a big head.  Another story I read this week was about the ancient king Xerxes. This will tell you a little bit about how big-headed these ancient leaders could be.\n\nXerxes was on his way to fight Greece, and one of the bridges they had just built was washed out by the river. So do you know what Xerxes did?  He wrote a long pronouncement against this river and commanded that his soldiers whip the river.   During another time, he threatened a mountain.  You want to talk about a big head.\n\nNebuchadnezzar was getting there.  He really had accomplished a lot.  He’d built an amazing empire.  He’d built palaces and gardens that were a wonder of the world.  He’d kept political factions at bay for decades.  He was the most powerful and respected man in the world.\n\nAnd he was obviously starting to believe his own press clippings, so God sent him this vision. In the vision, there was this amazing tree with its branches spreading far and wide.  The tree represents Nebuchadnezzar.  \n\nBut Brother Ernie comes and cuts the tree down right down to the stump, and he puts a metal band around the stump.  For seven years, that stump has to be low—down at grass level.\n\nThen after seven years, the tree grows again.  That was Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.  \n\nSo when Daniel hears it, he’s scared.  This isn’t a good dream for Nebuchadnezzar. He doesn’t want to tell it to him.\n\nBut he does.  He tells him that God is going to bring him low for seven years, and that he is going to be like a beast of the field.  Then after seven years, God will restore him.\n\nDoes Nebuchadnezzar listen? Does he repent?\n\nSkip down to verse 28, and let’s read the rest of the story:\n\n> *”28 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar. 29 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. 30 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honour of my majesty? 31 While the word [was] in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee. 32 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling [shall be] with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will. 33 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws]. 34 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion [is] an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom [is] from generation to generation: 35 And all the inhabitants of the earth [are] reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and [among] the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? 36 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. 37 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works [are] truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.”*\n\nNebuchadnezzar didn’t listen, so God drove him mad, and he went out into the fields and lived like a wild animal for seven years.  I can’t even imagine it.\n\nProverbs 16:18 says: \n\n> *”Pride [goeth] before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.”*\n\nGalatians 6:3 says:\n\n> *”For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.”*\n\nFinally, James 4:6 says:\n\n> *”But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.”* (James 4:6)\n\n\nBefore rebellion, there is pride.  Before theft, there is pride.  Before adultery, there is pride.\n\nThere is a little liar inside all of us constantly telling us that we are good; we are important; we deserve that raise; we deserve that recognition; people should be making a bigger deal about me.  This little liar looks at our accomplishments and rewrites the story to make us look really, really good.  \n\nPride makes us useless for God and unbearable to others.  Pride convinces us that we are the smartest person in the room, when what it’s really doing to us is blinding us to our own stupidity.  Pride and ego keep us from growing because you can’t grow when you’ve already arrived.\n\nThere is a little boy on the swim team who will not listen to his coaches.  He doesn’t swim right, you see, but he won’t listen.  He’s about six years old.  When you ask him why he won’t listen, he says, “I don’t have to listen. I won a ribbon last year.”\n\nProverbs 26:12 says: \n\n> *”Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? [there is] more hope of a fool than of him.”*\n\nThere are two main things I want us to learn from this story of Nebuchadnezzar being driven mad and sent into the wilderness.\n\n## 1. If you set yourself up, God will knock you down.\n\n> *” Every one [that is] proud in heart [is] an abomination to the LORD: [though] hand [join] in hand, he shall not be unpunished.”* (Proverbs 16:5)\n\n> *”A man's pride shall bring him low:”* (Proverbs 29:23a)\n\nIsaiah 2:11 says:\n\n> *”The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.”*\n\nCan you imagine God in heaven, looking down at frail little pipsqueaks like us, beating our chest and thinking we are something?\n\nI think He looks down on us and says, “Oh, that’s cute. Let me teach this guy his place.”  And then He does something—any of the millions of things He can do—to knock us down a peg.\n\nGod knows a million different recipes for humble pie, and He loves to feed it to us when we least want to eat it.\n\nNebuchadnezzar learned the hard way.  He got off easy.  Herod didn’t have so easy a time.  \n\nThere is only room at the top for one King of the Hill, and if you try to push God off and put yourself up there, you are cruising for a bruising.\n\n---\n\nA second thing thing I think we can learn from this passage is...\n\n## 2. God wants Christians to be humble.\n\nJames says, *”God gives grace to the humble.”*. Romans 12 says we should *”Mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate.  Be not wise in your own conceits.”*. Philippians says we should *”in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.”*\n\nThe greatest ability that God can use is humility.  Let the world beat their own chests and toot their own horns, but God is looking for humble people.\n\nThe very first words Jesus preached in the New Testament were *”Blessed are the poor in spirit.”*  A true Christian is humble.\n\nIf God hates it when a worldling is proud, how much more do you think it makes God sick when we Christians get proud?  It’s ugly on the world, but it’s absolutely repugnant on us.\n\nI have one more point.\n\n## 3. The way to stay humble is to look to Jesus.\n\nLook at Nebuchadnezzar’s last words in verse 37:\n\n> *”Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.”*\n\nGod had to bring Nebuchadnezzar down so Nebuchadnezzar would learn to look up.\n\n### A. Jesus is our great example of humility.\n\n> *”[Phl 2:5-9 KJV] 5  Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:”*\n\n### B. The gospel should remind us to stay humble.\n\nWe aren’t saved because we were good, but because we were bad.  We weren’t saved because of our ability, but through our inability.  We are redeemed sinners.",

    "body": "Take your Bibles again and turn to Ecclesiastes 2.  We are going to finish this chapter tonight.\n\nRemember Ecclesiastes is this really dark wisdom book.  It’s a book that takes an honest look at life “under the sun” or without God.  It’s a book that asks the tough questions - which Solomon calls “goads.”\n\nAnd remember that the guy who wrote it - Solomon - was uniquely qualified to write a book like this, because He was the richest man in the world, a ruler of the world, and one of the smartest people who ever lived.  He had the richest human experience imaginable: the best education, unlimited romance, unlimited money, unlimited achievement.  And here he is looking back at it all and writing an honest review of life.\n\nLet’s read verses 15-16 and we’ll break those verses down tonight:\n\n> *”15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also [is] vanity. 16 For [there is] no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now [is] in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise [man]? as the fool. 17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun [is] grievous unto me: for all [is] vanity and vexation of spirit. 18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. 19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise [man] or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This [is] also vanity. 20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun. 21 For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it [for] his portion. This also [is] vanity and a great evil. 22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 23 For all his days [are] sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity. 24 [There is] nothing better for a man, [than] that he should eat and drink, and [that] he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it [was] from the hand of God. 25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten [hereunto], more than I? 26 For [God] giveth to a man that [is] good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to [him that is] good before God. This also [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.”* \n\nI have a confession to make: I am a very, very ambitious person and I love to work.  I have a hard time taking a day off or even taking a couple of hours off.  I come from a long line of “workaholics” and I take great pride in working towards big goals.\n\nI’m not really into “stuff.”  I’m not a pleasure junkie.  I’m a work junkie.\n\nAnd this chapter hits me right between the eyes.\n\nIf you ask anyone how they are doing, what do they say?  The probably say “I’m so ____________?”  Busy.  Right.  Everyone is busy.  Everyone is just go, go, going all the time.  \n\nI want to ask you some questions from a book I read called “Crazy Busy” by Kevin DeYoung.  Just answer these to yourself:\n\n1. Do you regularly work 30 minutes a day longer than you are payed for?\n2. Do you check work email or phone messages at home?\n3. Has anyone ever said to you “I didn’t want to bother you because I know how busy you are?”\n4. Do your family or friends complain about not getting time with you?\n5. If tomorrow evening were unexpectedly freed up, would you use it to do work or a household chore?\n6. Do you often feel tired during the day and feel your neck and shoulders aching?\n7. Do you often exceed the speed limit when driving?\n8. Do you make use of flexible working arrangements at work?\n9. Do you pray with your children regularly?\n10. Do you have enough time to pray?\n11. Do you have a hobby in which you are actively involved?\n12. Do you eat together as a family or household at least once a day?\n\nA lot of us are workaholics.  And here is the thing, being “busy” and working hard can be just as much an idol or a drug as pleasure and stuff.  It can also whitewash an empty life and an empty heart.\n\n> Busyness serves as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness, obviously your life cannot possibly be silly or trivial or meaningless if you are so busy, completely booked, in demand every hour of the day.”\n\nThis passage in Ecclesiastes is all about workaholism.  The main point Solomon is making here is…\n\n# 1. The Problem with Work\nIn verses 15-23 Solomon makes two big points about work and why it is empty.  The first point he makes is…\n\n## Everything you work for goes to someone else. (18)\nLook at verse 18\n\n> *”Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? ”* \n\nThe truth is that every one of us is going to work and work and work and work and work but we don’t get to take it with us.  The old preacher statement “You never see a uHaul behind a herse” is true.  You can’t take it with you.\n\nWe spend our whole life building something and then have no control over what happens to it.  Someone else gets to enjoy the work that we have done.\n\nAs one of the commentators I read said:\n\n> This is one of the great frustrations of human experience.  We are born with a deep longing to have something, make something or do something that will last.  Yet the under-the-sun reality is that we will spend our whole lives working to gain something that we can never keep.\n\nAs I was working on this sermon I kept thinking about my grandfather.  My grandfather is a hard-working respectable man.  He built a good business and a good reputation.  He’s the kind of guy who has never missed a rotary club meeting in 30 something years.  He’s been very careful with his money and saved up as much as he could.\n\nBut do you know what - he’s in his upper 80s now and he doesn’t get to keep any of that. He might have a will, but who knows what the people he leaves his money to are going to do with it.  It has to be very, very frustrating to think about.\n\nThink about Solomon here.  Solomon worked very hard and became the wealthiest person in the world.  He grew his kingdom to be one the biggest kingdoms in the world.  But when Solomon died, his son Rehoboam took over and lost 80% of his father’s kingdom.\n\nYou don’t get to take it with you.  \n\nIn our house we have this walnut kitchen table we bought from a used furniture store.  When we bought it, it looked brand new even though it was over 50 years old.  Some dear old lady polished it and covered it and took very good care of that table.  It is obvious that she really really prized it and it meant something to her.\n\nThen…we got it.  Three babies ate their babies food on it.  Three kids do their homeschool on it.  It’s still a nice table - but let me tell you - it looks nothing like it did when we got it six years ago.\n\nListen - you can work all your life and some other chuckle head is going to come around and enjoy all of the work that you put into something.  They probably won’t care about your house or your car or your tool collection anywhere near as much as you do.  \n\nThat is a goad.  It’s the truth.\n\nA second goad about work, a second point Solomon was trying to make was… \n\n## Work is just plain hard and it never gets easier.\n\nLook at verses 22-23\n\n> *”For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?  For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.”*\n\nWhat is he saying there?  He is saying it is constantly on your mind.  You can’t shut it off.  Work is a constant drag.  Work even keeps us up at night.\n\nYou have too much work, then you don’t have enough work, then you have bills and problems and fires to put out and it just wears on you.  \n\nAnd Solomon says “All his days are sorrows” - It doesn’t get easier.  It is just relentless.  \n\nSo he comes to this conclusion about work and workaholism:  Living for work is empty. \n\nLook at verse 17: \n\n> *”Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.”*\n\nLook at verse 23:\n\n> *”Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.”*\n\nIt’s all empty.  It’s all vexation of spirit.  It doesn’t fulfill you.\n\nIt reminds me of something I read about Tom Brady getting interviewed after he won his third super bowl.  He broke down a bit in the interview and asked “Is this it?  It can’t be it.  I mean, there has to be more to it than this.”\n\nIt’s empty.  It doesn’t fulfill you.\n\n---\n\nNow, before we close tonight let’s look at Solomon’s conclusion. It’s actually a pretty surprising conclusion.\n\nVerse 24 says:\n\n> *”\"There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.”*\n\nThis is actually the first positive thing that Solomon says in this entire book.  What is Solomon saying here?\n\nThat’s actually our second point…\n\n\n# The Difference God makes\n\nSolomon just takes two chapters to tell us how empty pleasure and work are and then ends this second chapter by telling us that pleasure and work are gifts from God and that there is nothing better on this earth than to enjoy these gifts from God.\n\nHuh??\n\nYou see - the difference between empty pleasures and fulfilling pleasures is the place God has in your life.\n\nThe difference between work just being a drag and work being a blessing and a joy is the place God has in your life.\n\nWork is a gift.  Work isn’t a curse.  It’s a gift. When God put Adam in the garden, long before the fall, Adam had a job.  When we get to heaven, when sin isn’t even in the picture anymore.  We are going to have a job.\n\nWork, when God is in it, is a gift.  \n\nThat’s why Colossians 3 says:\n\n> *”Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God: 23And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;”*\n\nEven servants can work heartily.  They can sweep the floor for God.  They can clean the toilet for God.  They can do it for secular bosses but if God is in the right place in their life - there is meaning there.\n\nI’m going to come back and make the same point I made last week - you can work and work and work and work and work.  But God controls what happens in the occasion and the real key isn’t more work or less work.  The real key isn’t more pleasure or less pleasure.  The real key is putting God in the right place in your life.",

    "body": "# James 4:1-3 - The Enemy Within: How The Desire For Pleasure is the Enemy\nOne of the things I’ve been getting into a bit lately is reading about Greek philosophy.  We all know the names of Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates, but do you know the name Aristippus?  \n\nAristippus was a student of Socrates, and he founded a branch of Greek philosophy called “Hedonism.”  His basic premise should sound familiar.  He said that everybody has the right to do everything in their power to achieve the greatest amount of pleasure possible to them, and that the only true good is having far more pleasure than pain.  He said that pleasure is the highest good.\n\nHedonism is still around.  There are a lot of people today who believe that the highest good is in getting and doing whatever makes you happy.  Hedonism drives a lot of the pro-homosexuality stuff taking over the world today.  Hedonism is behind a lot of Libertarianism.  It’s this idea that if something makes someone happy, who are we to say anything about it?  Hedonism is even in Declaration of Independence (“Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”).  That “pursuit of happiness” part is pure hedonism.\n\nI’m talking about hedonism tonight because hedonism comes from the Greek word *“hēdonē”*—a word that our King James version translates as either “pleasure” or “lusts”—and our text tonight is all about *“hēdonē”*  It’s all about these strong desires for pleasure that all of us have.\n\nSpoiler alert: The Bible doesn’t take the same stand on pleasure as the hedonists; not even close.  In fact, the title of our message tonight is **The Enemy Within: How The Desire For Pleasure is the Enemy.**\n\nLet’s read James 4:1-3 together:\n\n> *”1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? 2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.”*  (James 4:1-3 KJV)\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had this man in our church who was a dear friend named Mr. Wakim.  Mr. Wakim is a smart, hard-working, faithful Christian who immigrated to the United States from Lebanon when he was a young man.  He is the type of Christian who is in church three times a week and who comes to visitation.  His kids went to Christian school and Christian colleges.  He is a super good guy.\n\nAnyways, Mr. Wakim spoke to us in chapel one day. I don’t know why, but he showed us a bunch of slides from his childhood in Lebanon.  The slides were amazing!  What a beautiful country!  It has amazing beaches 30 minutes away from snow covered mountains and rich history everywhere.  This is a part of the world right on top of Israel.  It’s in the Bible many times, and yet they had every modern amenity you can think of.  I remember sitting in that chapel, looking at those pictures, and thinking, “That is what paradise looks like.” \n\nBut towards the end of his slides, he started to show different kinds of pictures.  The beautiful cities he showed us were full of rubble and bullet holes.  The peaceful villages and houses were now craters.  In a short period of time in the late 70s and 80s, his whole world was destroyed by war.   His family had to run for their lives, and their only option was to find refuge in America.  Their home was completely destroyed.\n\nI’ll never forget the emotion.  Mr. Wakim is not a super emotional guy, but he was crying as he showed us those last slides.  His paradise had turned into hell on earth.\n\nThat’s what war does.  War takes people’s kids away.  War leaves people maimed and broken for the rest of their lives.  War gives mental scars to people that they often never recover from.  War dislodges people from their families and drives happy, peaceful people into poverty.  War shatters dreams.\n\nWhen James said, “From whence come wars and fightings among you?” he wasn’t talking about real wars and actual fistfights.  He was talking about interpersonal squabbles in the church, but he picked his words very carefully.  He wanted us to understand that these little fights among brothers—just like real wars—turn happy peaceful places to rubble, turn homes into bombshells, and turn friends into enemies.\n\nJust like war, relationship troubles can make your life a living hell.  Just like war, relationship troubles can ruin your dreams.\n\nAnd James tells us what causes this relationship chaos… \n\n> *”Come they not hence, even of your lusts.”*\n\nJames says that the relationship problems we face are all caused by the same thing: Your lusts; your *hēdonē;* your selfish desires.\n\nNow the word “lust” in modern English is almost always used for something sexual, but that’s not what the word means here.  It can mean that, for sure, but it’s talking about any strong desire or craving.   It could be the desire for pleasure, the desire for food, the desire for recognition, the desire for power, the desire for adventure, the desire for prestige, or even the desire for comfort.  \n\nThe whole world system is designed to activate these desires.  Every advertisement you watch is geared at one of these things.  Drive a BMW and be important, experience the power.  Buy a Swiffer Wet Jet and enjoy ease and comfort of having clean floors without the work.  There are constant messages telling you, “You need this and you have to have that,” that we read, hear, and see hundreds of times every day.\n\nAnd these ad guys aren’t stupid.  They know how to hook you.  They know that inside each one of you is a wanter, and if they can just turn that wanter on, they can sell whatever it is they are selling, whether it’s $80,000 cars or $8 laundry detergent.\n\n We all have *hēdonē.* We all have these internal desires.  I think James knew about some specific little quarrels going on in the churches he was writing about.  I think the people in those churches knew about them, too.  I think James was saying, “Look, see those battles that are causing all that destruction?  Where are they coming from?  They are coming from your own internal cravings; your own internal desires.”\n\nI read a book recently called *Ego is the Enemy,* and it was all about how our ego destroys everything.  I think the point of these verses is that our selfish desires—our lust—are the enemy within, and they cause all kind of mayhem and destruction.\n\nLet me give you three things our selfish desires destroy from these verses.\n\nThe first one I’m sure you can guess:\n\n## 1. Selfish desires ruin our relationships (1)\n\nVerse 1 says:\n\n> *”1 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?”*\n\nLike I said earlier, I think James is using the language of war here to paint a picture: Relationship carnage; dream destruction; ugly, bitter infighting;  jealousy. \n\nYou’ve seen it.  \n\n* Maybe it’s the family that implodes in divorce, and they can’t even speak about each other without saying something nasty.\n* Maybe it’s the guy who leaves the church and harbors hate in his heart for everyone who stays.\n* Maybe it’s the brothers and sisters who go to war with each other over an inheritance when mom dies.\n* Maybe it’s the parent-child relationship destroyed by drunkeness or drug abuse.\n\nThis kind of relationship rubble is everywhere.  I would bet that if you were to just walk down the street and look inside every house, 80% of them would have some of this relationship rubble, and it’s so destructive.\n\nThe world can make all kinds of excuses for this behavior, but God isn’t pleased with it. Its source is always some kind of sin, and that sin always has an element of “lust” in it.\n\n* lust for a different spouse\n* lust for more money\n* lust for more stuff\n* lust for more attention from the church\n* lust for a bigger chunk of the inheritance\n* lust for the high you get from some drug\n\nAnd if we let these lusts run our life, then they are going to leave a trail of destruction.  They are going to leave broken relationships.  They are going to leave hurt children.  They are going to leave imploding homes.  It’s going to be ugly.\n\nSelfish desires ruin our relationships.\n\nPoint number two is…\n\n## 2. Selfish desires sabotage our satisfaction (2)\nVerse 2 says:\n\n> *”Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.”*\n\nSelfish desires are like an itch that cannot be scratched.  They cannot be satisfied.  As soon as you get what you want, you move on immediately to the next thing.  It never stops.  The toys just get more expensive and the vacations just get more extravagant, but the desires are never satisfied.\n\nAnd what James is saying here is that when we let these selfish desires rule our life, it causes us to do things we wouldn’t do otherwise.  It leads us into sin.  It leads us into questionable actions.  It leads us to steal, to insult, to hurt, or to cheat.  \n\nSpurgeon said:\n\n> “The whole history of mankind shows the failure of evil lustings to obtain their object.”\n\nIn other words, selfish desires never satisfy.  Whatever it is that you think will make you happy, it won’t.\n\nI love to travel; I love to see new places; and I love to try awesome food.  Imagine if you could do that for a living: Travel around the world; eat the best food; see awesome exotic things every day.  Imagine if you could be famous for it and get paid millions for it.  You’d have your own TV shows and best-selling books.  Imagine that you were a cultural hero for it. Wouldn’t that be a dream life?  That’s the life of Anthony Bourdain, and he committed suicide recently.\n\nImagine living in a $20 million apartment in New York City, with a second mansion out in the Hamptons.  Imagine having an empire of people working for you and all the money you could ever need. Imagine getting up every day and doing what you’d dreamed of doing your whole life and being known for it around the world.  Imagine being at the very top of an industry and having your face on magazines everywhere.  That was Kate Spade, who committed suicide the same day as Anthony Bourdain.\n\nWe think riches will make us happy, and yet rich people still get divorced.  Rich people take illicit drugs.  Rich people steal to try to get even richer.  \n\nWe think success will make us happy, and yet famously successful people self-destruct for all the world to see every day.  \n\nWe think fame will make us happy, and yet Hollywood has no shortage of rehab facilities and psychologists that stay very, vey busy.  \n\nSatisfaction isn’t found in having what you want; it’s found in wanting what you have.  You don’t get satisfaction by getting it all; you get satisfaction by getting control of your wanter.  Actually, you get satisfaction by giving over your wanter to Jesus and trusting Him with what He gives back.\n\nI Timothy 6:6 says *”But godliness with contentment is great gain.”*\n\nLet me be clear: God isn’t against having stuff; God isn’t against having fun; God isn’t against being successful or recognized for your work.  None of that is bad, but what kills us is our desire for it.  What kills us is when we turn it into an idol.  \n\nIt ruins our contentment and ruins our happiness.\n\nSo this enemy within ruins our relationships, and it sabotages our satisfaction. There’s one more thing we see in the end of verse 2 and the beginning of verse 3:\n\n> *”yet ye have not, because ye ask not. 3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.”*\n\nThe third thing selfish desires do is…\n\n## 3. Selfish desires impair our prayers (3)\n\nJames is saying here that because we let selfish desires have their way in our heart...\n\n1. Selfish desires keep us from praying because we are caught up in idolatry and self-sufficiency.\n2. If we did pray, we wouldn’t get our selfish desires, but we’d get our selfish desires worked out.  God doesn’t give us our wants; He fixes our wanter.\n3. When we do pray, our prayers are carnal and pointless, and we don’t get what we pray for.",

    "body": "When you backed out of your driveway this morning? Did you think through each step? Did you think about it at all?\n\nThink about all of the steps: * Open the door. * Swing your leg up into the car. * Pull yourself into the car. * Close the door. * Find your keys in your purse (or pocket.) * Find the car key on the key ring. * Insert the key, the right way, into the ignition. * Place your foot on the brake. * Turn the ignition. * Put the car in reverse. * Check your rear view mirror for things behind you. * Take your foot off of the brake and put it on the gas. * Skillfully navigate your driveway in reverse. * Take your foot off of the gas and put it on the brake. * Find the gear shifter with your right hand. * Switch from reverse to drive. * Put your foot on the gas.\n\nDid you think about each step? I mean that’s a pretty complicated task. Remember the first time you were learning to do it? Remember how nervous you were when you were learning to drive and had to do all that. So did you think through each task this morning?\n\nProbably not. That’s because habit took over.\n\nLet me ask you another question: On your way to church this morning, were you thinking about the road, or was your mind on something else? Were you thinking about church or lunch or work or your afternoon plans?\n\nProbably, right? Why didn’t you crash?\n\nBecause our brains have the abilities to take complex tasks and turn do them in auto-pilot. Our brains can handle habits.\n\nSo much of our life is habit. My girls are learning to type. It’s so funny watching them have to think about where the “l” key is. I type like 70 words a minute all the time and I never think about where the keys are. If you know how to type, that is stored in habit and you just type.\n\nSimilarly, you don’t think about brushing your teeth when you wake up in the morning or how to tie your shoes. You just do it.\n\nOur habits are like little code blocks that our brain just reruns so it doesn’t have to write out the whole thing.\n\nHabit is such a powerful thing.\n\nToday is new years day. Traditionally, around this time of year, people are making out their new years resolutions. Your resolution may be to lose weight, to exercise, to read more, or to get out of debt. Maybe your resolution is to take up a hobby. Maybe it’s to quit smoking. Maybe it’s to read the Bible more.\n\nI’ve made several new years resolutions this year: * I’m going to get my personal scheduling under control. * I’m going to turn my website business into a non-profit that creates free to use software for churches. * I’m going to go back to reading two or more books a month. * I’m going to run a half-ironman triathlon. * I’m going to start making time to go on a date with my wife at least twice a month.\n\nResolutions?\n\nI hope you have resolutions. I hope you are setting goals. He who aims at nothing always hits his mark. I hope you are striving towards something and trying.\n\nIf you noticed, almost all of my resolutions are going to require new habits. 90% of the time, that’s what resolutions are, they are the decision to try to make new habits.\n\nOver the next four weeks, I’m going to be preaching a little mini-series called “resolutions: four habits to add for stronger Christian living.” Each week, I’m going to be introducing a new resolution, a new habit I think you should work on in 2017, and I’m going to go to the Bible to make my case for why.\n\nToday, I want to give you the first resolution. I’m calling it “the faithfulness resolution.” It’s really simple: resolve to be faithful to church and Sunday School.\n\nI think church attendance and yes, Sunday School attendance, should be a habit. It shouldn’t require a decision. It shouldn’t be an option. It should just be something that you and I do as Christians almost automatically.\n\nI think it should be a priority. I think it should be your default.\n\nNow, for some of us, this is easy. My stepfather got saved when I was about Audrey’s age. For nearly 30 years, I can count the number of times I didn’t go to church on Sunday on one hand. I’ve been sick a couple of times. I’ve been snowed in a couple of times. But for the most part, we have always been in church on Sunday. If we were home or are home, we are their for Sunday School and Sunday Night church too.\n\nNow, there have been times when that was difficult. I spent most weekends as a teenager at my dad’s house who is not a christian. He didn’t take me to church and didn’t encourage me to go. I had to fight him a little on that. I had to fight when I got a new job to make sure they didn’t schedule me on Sunday Morning. There have been various times in our life when we had to travel a half-hour to get to church.\n\nAnd, honestly, there have been strong temptations to do other things. I said one of my resolutions this year is to do a half-ironman. Almost all of those are on Sunday. I get invited to run races with my friends all the time that are on Sunday.\n\nListen, I feel like I’m boasting. But this isn’t boasting. I mean, this is so elementary. So basic. It would be like saying “I haven’t had a potty accident in 30 years” is boasting. It’s that basic. It should be that automatic.\n\nBut it isn’t automatic. Only about 18% of the U.S. population regularly attends church. Only about 50% of those who are members of Bible preaching churches attend every week. A lot of people claim to be Christians but aren’t making church attendance a priority.\n\nSo I’m going to ask you - the people in this room this morning - to make this a priority. I’m going to ask you to make attending church something you do almost automatically. Make it a habit.\n\nI’m also going to ask you to try to join a Sunday School class and be faithful to it. A Sunday school class will connect you with a smaller group in the church, give you another avenue to get involved, expose you to more teaching, and help you stay accountable. It is NOT a second service. It’s much more casual and it’s different. You already have to wake up to get here - how much harder would it be to come an hour earlier?\n\nSo that’s my plea this morning: Make coming to church and coming to Sunday school a habit. Make it automatic. The faithfulness resolution means be faithful to church.\n\nNow, why? What biblical basis do I have to ask you to do this? Let me give you five reasons why I think you should make it a habit to attend church:\n\nThe first reason is:\n\n1. Habitual, prioritized church attendance helps establish right priorities in your life.\nTake your Bibles and turn with me to Romans chapter 12. Romans 12. Let’s look at verse 1:\n\n”I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.”\n\nThis verse tells us that God wants us to give ourselves as a living sacrifice to Him. He wants all of us. He wants to be first place in our lives.\n\nThen it says “which is your reasonable service.”\n\nIf God really exists. If God really gave His only begotten son to die for us and if He has really made us a part of His family, If He has really bought us back out of the slavery of sin. Then listen, anything God asks of us is a reasonable service.\n\nIf someone sacrificed himself to save your life tomorrow, you would likely go to him and say “Anything I can do to repay you - please let me know.” That’s reasonable.\n\nOk. Listen, if we can’t make church attendance a priority - what does that say about where our priorities in life are?\n\nMake no mistake about it - God expects his children. His people. The redeemed. He expects them to gather together at least once a week for church. Over and over and over in the New Testament we see this.\n\nYou see this in Romans 12. Skim down to verses 4-5. Look at verse 5:\n\n”So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.”\n\nPaul moves seamlessly from talking about our reasonable service to God to the way we view our church family and the ministry that we have to our church family.\n\nWhatever your reasonable service is - it includes church attendance at the very minimum!\n\nYou might say “I don’t have time.” That’s not a statement of time - its a statement of priorities. We make time for what is important to us.\n\nThe average American makes time to watch 4 hours and 51 minutes of TV every day. They make time for a total of more than 10 hours a day of screen time.\n\nI don’t know where you fall on that average - but if you have time to watch, say 2 hours a day of TV - that’s way below average - but it’s still 14 hours a week. If you have time to watch 14 hours a week of tv but you don’t have two hours a week to spend in church - what does that say about your priorities.\n\nHabitual, prioritized church attendance helps establish right priorities in your life.\n\nThe second reason why you should resolve to attend church faithfully is...\n\n2. Habitual, prioritized church attendance is a terrific testimony to those who are watching your life.\nColossians 4:5-6 says:\n\n”5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 6 Let your speech [be] alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.”\n\nThat phrase, or some form of it, “them that are without” is found several times in the New Testament. The idea it carries is this: the lost world is watching you. Here in this passage it hints that they are watching how we use our time.\n\nChurch, one of the best testimonies you can have in this lost world is to be someone who prioritizes regular church attendance. I promise you, if you make church attendance a priority - you will stand out.\n\nYou’ll stand out on the ball teams when they want to schedule games on Sunday.\nYou’ll stand out with your girlfriends who want to do brunch on Sunday morning.\nYou’ll stand out at work when everyone is having their “what did you do Sunday” conversation.\nYou’ll stand out when your lost loved ones schedule family get-togethers on Sunday morning at noon.\nIf you resolve to faithfully attend church, you are going to stand out. And do you know what? That’s a good thing.\n\nThere are some people who use Christianity as an excuse to be a straight up weirdo. They love that “peculiar people” passage a little too much. But there is a good way to be a weirdo. If you have your priorities right in this lost world, you are going to be a bit of a weirdo.\n\nListen folks - they might not seem like it - but they ARE watching. They do notice when you get your family up every Sunday and take them to church. They do notice when that seems like a priority. It does help give you a testimony.\n\nLook at a third reason to resolve to church attendance with me:\n\n3. Habitual, prioritized church attendance will enable growth through the food of the word of God.\n1 Peter 5:2 says to pastors:\n\n”Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;”\n\n2 Timothy 4:2 says to pastors:\n\n”Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.”\n\nEphesians 4:11-13 says:\n\n”[Eph 4:11-13 KJV] 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:”\n\nGod has a plan for Christian growth, and that plan requires church attendance. It requires you to get under the sound of preaching and to do so regularly.\n\nIt’s interesting that there aren’t a lot of scriptures that directly mention church attendance. There is one in the book of Hebrews we’ll get to in a minute. But that is about it. Do you know why there aren’t a lot of verses about this?\n\nBecause it’s assumed. Every letter of Paul was to a church. In order for that letter to be read, the church had to be together. Diddo with the gospels. Diddo with the other letters. They all assume church attendance.\n\nThe plan of God is to grow his church through the preaching and teaching of the word. That assumes and requires church attendance.\n\nThe pastors job is to feed you. They can’t do that if you don’t show up regularly for meals.\n\nAlso, listen, the whole analogy of meals makes this out to be something that you need on a regular basis. You don’t eat once a month. I eat every day. Several times a day. I need to or I can’t function. Maybe if you are spiritually anemic, you need to show up to meal time more.\n\nTwo more:\n\n4. Habitual, prioritized church attendance will allow you to get involved and minister - which is God’s plan for every Christian.\nOne of our mottos here at Bible Baptist is “every member a minister.” We just read Ephesians 4:11-14. I want to read that again:\n\n”[Eph 4:11-13 KJV] 11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: 13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:”\n\nThere are two ways to read verse 12. You can read it “God gave all these professionals for the perfecting of the saints and the work of the ministry.” In other words, it’s the pastors job to do the work of the ministry.\n\nBut that actually isn’t the way most commentators read this passage. Most people see it to mean “God gave all these professionals for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry.”\n\nIn other words, it’s not the pastors job to do the work of the ministry. It’s the pastors job to prepare the people to do the work of the ministry.\n\nEverybody in the new testament church is supposed to have a ministry. Everybody is supposed to have a job. The Bible uses the term “members” often. That isn’t members like being a member at Sam’s club. The word “member” in the King James means body part. Literally, you are a body part in the local church. Think about your body, every part has a job and they are all necessary.\n\nIf you are saved. IF God wants you in a church. You are a necessary body part of that church and you should have some kind of ministry there. It’s very hard to be a ministering body part if you aren’t there faithfully.\n\nLet me give you one more reason and we’ll quit:\n\nI’m going to close by looking at the most popular and famous verse on this topic in the whole Bible. To my knowledge, it’s the only verse that DIRECTLY addresses this topic. Turn with me to Hebrews 10. The verse everyone knows is verse 25. But we are going to start in verse 23:\n\n”23 Let us hold fast the profession of [our] faith without wavering; (for he [is] faithful that promised;) 24 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: 25 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some [is]; but exhorting [one another]: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.”\n\nThese verses are speaking directly about church attendance. ”not forsaking the assembling of yourself together.” That’s about church attendance. But I want you to notice the REASON why we are not to forsake church attendance. Notice the last half of verse 25:\n\n”But exhorting one another.”\n\nThen look up to verse 24, the phrase right before the famous “not forsaking the assembling” verse:\n\n”And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works.”\n\nHere is the last reason why I think you should make faithful church attendance a resolution in 2017.\n\n5. Habitual, prioritized church attendance enables you to build relationships with other Christians so you can do your part to encourage your church family.\nIf you are a child of God - you aren’t an only child. We live in such an individualistic culture - but the Bible is not an individualistic book. So much of it is directed to groups, so much of it is about belonging to a group. So many of our responsibilities as Christians are responsibilities to a group.\n\nYou are supposed to be exhorting your fellow Christians. That word “exhort” means to call to ones side, to beseech, to comfort, to pray, to challenge. Have you ever had some one pull you aside and say “I know you are struggling with this - let me challenge you to.” or “let me pray about that with you.” or “Is there anything I can help you with.” We are supposed to be doing that.\n\nDo you know why we sing songs in church? Part of it is worship to God, but that’s not all of it. One of the reasons we are commanded to sing is because we are teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual psalms. When you sing out in congregational singing - it’s like you are preaching a sermon to the other people on the pew. That’s a biblical responsibility we have to one another.\n\nI could go on and on about this. But let me just give you some homework: search the New Testament for passages that talk about “one another” or “to another.” There are dozens of them.\n\nYou can’t obey those “one another” commands if you are not with one another and the best way to be with one another is to be in church faithfully.\n\nSo I want to challenge you this morning: make church attendance a habit. Make it automatic. Make it a priority.\n\nI hope you don’t feel like I’m beating you up this morning. That’s not my intention. I just know from experience how valuable and essential this habit is and I’m pleading to you: make it a priority. Make it a resolution:\n\nIt will help you keep your priorities right.\nIt will help keep your testimony strong.\nIt will help you to grow.\nIt will enable you to minister.\nIt will give you opportunities to fulfill the “one another” passages in the New Testament.",

    "body": "I want to start tonight kind of weird. There is this book I've read that I really like. I dug around for about an hour looking for it today and couldn't find it. (Must have lent it to someone.) So I just printed off a picture of the cover. The book was written by a couple of Ivy League professors who are brothers named Chip and Dan Heath and it's called \"Made to Stick: Why some ideas survive and others die.\"\n\nHow many commercials have you seen over the years? Probably 1,000s right? But some of them stick to you. You never forget them. Remember \"This is your brain - this is your brain on...\" Remember \"Where's the beef?\" Why do you remember those commercials but you forget the commercial for the car lot up the road?\n\nThey did a lot of research on this and they came up with a simple acronym. If it's going to stick - it's got to follow the SUCCESS acronym:\n\nsimple,\nunexpected,\nconcrete,\ncredible,\nemotional,\nand have a story.\nSuccess.\n\nYou all know the story of Abraham and Isaac. I doubt there is anybody in here - even the little kids - who couldn't tell me the basics of the story.\n\nThink about it from the standpoint of Made to Stick:\n\nThis story is as simple as it could be. God tells Abraham to Sacrifice his son, Abraham obeys God.\n\nIt is unexpected. No one reading the great story of the promises of God to Abraham and then the birth of Isaac is thinking - I know what's coming next - God is going to tell Abraham to murder this kid. No! This comes out of nowhere.\n\nIt is concrete. The picture of a little boy on an altar, sitting on top of fire wood with his father standing over him with a knife. Nothing is more concrete than that.\n\nIt is credible - it's in the Bible.\n\nIt is emotional. This may be the most emotional story in the whole Bible. It touches a cord in all of us.\n\nAnd of course it's a story. So you remember it.\n\nBut as you read it - I want you to think about something: What was God doing? What was God up to? I mean - why?? That's the angle we are going to take tonight and I think it is going to teach you a lot about our God and our walk with Him.\n\nLet's read the chapter.\n\nSo what is God doing here? What is God up to?\n\nI mean, when you think about this story - it doesn't look good. Can you imagine the field day the God-haters have with a story like this. What's God up to?\n\nI think there are two things going on in this story and once you understand what those two things are the story takes on a totally different meaning.\n\nThe first thing we see God up to in this story is:\n\n1. We see a test for Abraham\nVerse 1 says:\n\n\"And it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham.\"\n\nI think the word \"tempt\" there is unfortunate. James 1:13 says:\n\n\"Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any man.\"\n\nI'm not saying the word \"tempt\" is a mistake here. I'm just saying I think we have to look a little deeper. If you look at the Hebrew word \"nacah\" you'd see that it means:\n\nto test, try, prove, tempt, assay, put to the proof or test\n\nIf you look how it is used in the Old Testament you'd find that about half the time, its translated \"prove\" and sometimes it's translated \"try.\"\n\nAn old preacher named F.B. Meyer said this about it:\n\nSatan TEMPTS people to do evil. God tests people to bring out good.\n\nI think that is what is going on here. God is testing Abraham. He's not trying to trip up Abraham - He knows Abraham can do it. He's trying to bring out the good in Abraham's life by bringing Abraham through this time of testing.\n\nA good teacher doesn't give a test until he knows his students can pass it. Believe me, if I gave my students a test and I hadn't prepared them for it - it wasn't going to be them that was in trouble - but me.\n\nI think God works the same way. God had been preparing Abraham for this test for 50 years. Through other smaller tests God was prepping him for the big test.\n\nSo God says to Abraham -\n\n\"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\"\n\nThis came out of the blue. No warning. I'm sure Abraham must of felt blindsided by this test.\n\nLet's take a close look. See first that it was:\n\nA. A Test of Abraham's communion.\nAbraham would have never heard this test had he not been communicating with God. The easiest thing for Him would have been to say \"That wasn't God speaking to me - that was some bad pizza or something.\" But Abraham had heard God's voice so many times by this point He knew who was talking to him. He knew it was God.\n\nAnd he knew that it was...\n\nB. A test of Abraham's love.\nAgain, look at verse 2. God said \"Take thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest.\"\n\nAbraham kind of got setup here. He had been looking forward to Isaac for years. Decades. That child meant more to him than anything in the whole world. He was Isaac. He was laughter. He was his only son Isaac.\n\nBut God wanted to see who was more important to Abraham - God or God's blessing. The child of promise or the one who did the promising. It was a test of Abraham's love.\n\nIn much the same way - God wants us to love Him. WHoleheartedly - more than anything else. Matthew 10:37 says:\n\n\"He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.\" (Mt. 10:37)\n\nDeuteronomy 6:5 - a passage every jew would know by heart says -\n\n\"And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.\" (Dt. 6:5)\n\nGod wants us to love Him above all others. More than your wife. More than your children. More than anything. God wants us to love Him. He was testing that in Abraham here.\n\nThird, it was...\n\nC. A test of Abraham's obedience.\nI think this was the main test. Jesus said (in John 14:15)\n\n\"If ye love me, keep my commandments.\"\n\nAbraham had the hardest commandment ever to obey. He was to take his son, his only son, and march three days journey into a group of mountains and sacrifice his son there.\n\nThis was the ultimate test of obedience and love.\n\nAnd what does Abraham do? He gets up early in the morning and does it. He obeys. He doesn't even let one of his servants saddle his donkey. He obeys right away. He doesn't even know what specific mountain he is going to - doesn't matter. He obeys. Right away. No question. No delay. No protest.\n\nI can't even get my kids to obey right away about little things - but Abraham was so conditioned to obey God that the biggest commandment and hardest commandment he could ever get He obeyed right away.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean it wasn't hard. It doesn't mean it wasn't emotional. It doesn't mean Abraham didn't choke up. I don't imagine there was a lot of talking going on on that 3 day hike to Mt. Moriah. But he obeyed.\n\nDo you love God enough to keep His commandments? Are there any commandments of God that you are just like \"Eh...no. Not going to happen God.\" Can I say something humbly - as someone who probably isn't much better than you and may be worse - that's about as much as you love God.\n\nSometimes we play this game with the kids where we say \"How much do you love me?\" And they say \"THIIIISSS MUCH!\" When God says \"How much do you love me?\" and we refuse to obey His commandments - He knows how much.\n\nWhat is it? Your entertainment choices? Your friends? Your porn addiction? Your job. Your savings account? Your time? Your clothes? What is it that is off limits to God?\n\nThis much...and no more.\n\nAbraham passed this test of His obedience.\n\nThe last part of this test is it was...\n\nD. A test of Abraham's faith\nYou see - God had promised Abraham that He would be blessed and the father of many nations. God had specifically told Abraham that that would come through Isaac and not Ishmael. Abraham had specific promises to hang onto.\n\nThis was a test of faith. It was God seeing if Abraham believed that God would keep His promises.\n\nAnd Abraham passed the test. Look what Abraham said in verse 5:\n\n\"And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.\"\n\nWow. \"We are going to worship. We will come again.\"\n\nAbraham knew that no matter what happened up there - Isaac was coming down that mountain.\n\nAnd by the way - God didn't disappoint. God waited until He knew - and then God stopped Abraham.\n\nSo this was a testing of Abraham and Abraham passed it. He didn't pass all his tests. Not by a long shot. But he passed this one.\n\nSo what is God doing? He's giving Abraham a test. But I don't think that is the main thing God was doing in this passage. The second thing we see in this passage is:\n\n2. We see a testament for us.\nYou see - God is trying to teach us about Himself. Remember the \"made to stick\" illustration. Remember the acronym. No one knows better how to get things to stick with us than God. He made us. Telling us \"I'm almighty\" or \"I'm gracious\" doesn't translate to us very well - showing us through a concrete story like this sinks in a little more.\n\nThere are five things this is a testament of about God. Five things God was teaching us in Genesis 22 about Himself.\n\nFirst, it is...\n\nA. A testament of God's place.\nGod wants us to love Him more than anything. He is a jealous God. He commands that we love Him with all of our heart and soul and mind. He wants first place in our life.\n\nHow clearly we see that in Abraham! We know how much Isaac meant to Abraham - and yet God had to mean more.\n\nWhat is it in your life that means more than God?\n\nSecond, it was...\n\nB. A testament of God's provision.\nAt the end of this chapter Abraham calls this place \"Jehova-jireh\" \"Jehovah Provides.\"\n\nGod was always going to provide a lamb. God was always going to provide a ram in the thickets.\n\nGod knows us - He knows how frail we are and how weak we are. He knows we cannot pass His ultimate test - so He provided us a lamb. He provided us Christ. This passage so beautifully foreshadows that.\n\nWhich brings me to the next thing:\n\nC. A testament of God's plan.\nThe mountain that Isaac was to be offered on - that's the very same mountain the temple would sit. It's within eyeshot of the place where God would offer His only son Jesus Christ. That's the real Lamb that God was going to provide.\n\nYou see, nothing we can bring to God is really worthwhile. It's all tainted. We are sinners. None of our sacrifices are going to do the trick. But God provided the perfect lamb. Spotless - not one speck of sin. Human but still God. God poured out the wrath that we deserve on His only Son Jesus Christ and because of that - we get to walk back down the mountain as new people.\n\nThere is so much symbolism in this story. There is Isaac who symbolizes Jesus. He doesn't say a word. At some point Isaac understood what was going on. But he didn't squeem. It's like Jesus. Isaiah 53:6 said about our Lord:\n\n\"He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth.\"\n\nGod knows what He is doing - and this whole thing forshadows Jesus.\n\nBut there is a flip side to that. The fourth thing this is a testament of is, it is...\n\nD. A testament of God's passion.\nYou see - we don't think about this so much - but it costs God the Father something to sacrifice God the son. There is so much in the Bible about what Jesus gave. But it wasn't just Jesus who sacrificed on Calvary.\n\nThere probably isn't a better story that shows us what it cost the Father. His only begotten son.\n\nThere's a story about an old man who opperated a train bridge. His job was just to switch the tracks when the train was coming over the bridge so that it wouldn't go off a cliff. This man had one son.\n\nOne day, that man was out at his post and he heard the train coming and then he heard something else. He heard his son stuck in the tracks. He had to make a decision. He didn't have time. His son or all of the people on that train. The train was coming. There wasn't time. What would you do?\n\nIt costs our Father something. We forget that. But it did.\n\nWe sing\n\nHow deep the fathers love for us. How vast beyond all measure. That He would send his only son. To make a wretch His treasure.\n\nIt costs Him something.\n\nOne last lesson here. This passage is:\n\nE. A testament of God's person.\nGod isn't trying to get something from you. He is trying to give something to you.\n\nGod won't hurt you.",

    "body": "# The Law of Sowing & Reaping\nQuick question: how many of you have ever heard anyone talk about “Karma?”\n\nI don’t think I ever heard that word until a few years ago, but it seems like it’s all over the place.  People talk about how “karma” is going to get you. And they’ll say “Don’t do that - it’s bad karma.”\n\nKarma is actually a pagan term.  It comes from hinduism.  Literally, the word means “action, work, or deed.”  But in Hinduism it has come to mean this - whatever you do today, will come back to bite you or bless you later.\n\nWe aren’t pagans.  I don’t like to use the word “Karma” because it’s a hindu word.  It’s a pagan word.  I think paganism is dangerous.  \n\nBut the idea of Karma - the idea that your actions today have consequences tomorrow - that’s not something Hinduism came up with.  The Hindus and the Bhuddists call it Karma - but we Christians call it the law of sowing and reaping.  \n\nLook at Galatians 6:7-10 with me:\n\n> *”[Gal 6:7-10 KJV] 7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting. 9 And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 10 As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all [men], especially unto them who are of the household of faith.”*\n\nThe Bible says “you reap what you sow.”  It means that your actions today have consequences for tomorrow.  \n\nPatch the Pirate has this song called “You reap what you sow” and it says \n\n> You reap what you sow, you get what you grow, this is the law that the Lord has made.  Give to others and you’ll never lack. Plant some good and your good will come back.\n\nI like that song.  They have another one called “the boomerang” that teaches this same principle:\n\n> The boomerangs gonna come back, gonna come back, gonna come back to you. So be careful what you say my friend and be careful what you do.  If you go through life, giving out evil you’ll get back evil too, cause the boomerang’s gonna come back, gonna come back, gonna come back to you.\n\nThe law of sowing and reaping.  This is actually something that you see in many places in the Bible:\n\n* The book of Job talks about sowing wickedness\n* The proverbs talk about sowing discord and sowing righteousness\n* The book of Hosea talks about “Sowing to the wind and reaping the whirlwind” and in another verse “Sowing righteousness and reaping mercy”\n* 2 Corinthians 9:6 says: *”But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.”* \n\nYou reap what you sow.\n\nOf course, these are farming words.  Sowing is another word for planting seed.  Reaping is another word for harvesting seed.  What this is saying in modern terms is “you harvest what you plant.”  But I like the old King James “You reap what you sow.”\n\nAnd this is a spiritual law of nature.  Just like you can’t cheat gravity - if you go up you are coming down.  You can’t cheat the second law of thermodynamics - things will result in chaos if you don’t work against them.  You can’t cheat the law of sowing and reaping - if you sow, you will reap.\n\n\nNow, a couple of thoughts about this law of sowing and reaping that I think we need to understand:\n\n# The law\n\n## 1. You always reap WHAT you sow.\n\nThis means, that if you plant corn, you aren’t going to grow watermelons.  If you plant soy beans, you aren’t going to grow tomatoes.  Whatever kind of seed you put in the ground, when the harvest comes, that’s the crop that is coming up.\n\nYou reap WHAT you sow.\n\nNotice the passage here.  It says:\n\n> *”for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.  For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.”*\n\nGod is telling us - listen - if you sow bad stuff, you are going to get bad stuff.  If you sow good stuff, you are going to get good stuff.  If you sow spiritual actions - you’ll grow.  If you sow carnal actions - your Christian life will shrink.\n\nIn a sense, life is like a mirror, you get out of it what you put in. \n\nListen, if you can’t make church a priority, you aren’t going to grow spiritually.  If you don’t read your Bible, you aren’t going to grow spiritually.  You have to sow to the Spirit.\n\nAlternatively, if you hang around your bar hopping friends, you are going to become more carnal.  You are sowing to the flesh, and you’ll reap corruption.  If you fill your mind with filthy tv shows, or pornography, you are sowing the seeds of the flesh and you’ll reap corruption.\n\nIn the computer world, they have this acronym GIGO.  Garbage in - Garbage out.  The same is true in the Christian life.  If you are constantly living on a diet of the garbage of this world, it’s going to manifest itself in garbage actions in your life.\n\nYou are going to reap what you sow.  God is not mocked.  In other words, you won’t be the exception to this rule.  You won’t be the guy who throws garbage seed into the ground of your life and reaps a bountiful harvest. You have to sow righteousness and sow to the Spirit.\n\nYou always reap WHAT you sow.\n\n## Second, you always reap LATER than you sow.\n\nVerse 9 says:\n\n> *”And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.”*\n\nA farmer doesn’t plant his corn the second week of April and harvest the first week in May.  It takes time for a crop to grow.  It sometimes seems like it takes a long time.  \n\nYou can’t microwave a crop.  You can’t rush it.  It’s going to take it’s time.  It’s not a fast process.\n\nThe same is true for the consequences of our sowing.  You may be reading your Bible and going to church and you aren’t seeing the crop in your life you want yet - give it time.  In due season you will reap.  You can’t rush it.  It doesn’t happen overnight.\n\nMost worthwhile things take time to accomplish.  If you could decide this week you wanted to be an olympic Gold medalist in the 400 yard dash and accomplish it next week.  It wouldn’t be that special.  It takes a lifetime of sowing discipline to get there.\n\nI was eating a granola bar recently and on the wrapper it said “What are you doing today that your future self will thank you for?”\n\nIf you are sowing the right things today, your future self will be thankful.   You lay the foundation and you build the house brick by brick.  Hour by hour.  Minute by minute.  Decision by decision.\n\nYou will reap LATER than you sow.\n\nAnd listen, this is true for bad decisions too.  The bad decisions you make today will turn into bad harvests tomorrow.  \n* The lust you sow in your mind today will turn into adultery tomorrow.\n* The little sip you take today will turn into full-blown drunkenness tomorrow.\n\nLot didn’t set out to be a wicked man.  I imagine if you showed young Lot a video of the way old Lot was acting he’d say “never me.”  But he saw the well watered plains of Sodom and he thought it would be a good place to live.  But bad decision followed bad decision, and the rest is history.\n\nAs Emerson said: \n\n> Sow a thought, reap an action.  Sow an action, reap a habit.  Sow a habit, reap a character, sow a character, reap a destiny.  \n\nIt starts with a thought.  But sow enough thoughts and add enough time and you have a harvest.  \n\nYou will reap WHAT you sow.\nYou will reap LATER than you sow.\n\nOne more thought about the law of the harvest.  \n\n## Third, You will reap MORE than you sow.\n\nWhen you plant corn, each kernel becomes a plant.  That’s the goal at least.  So at harvest time, if you sow 500 kernels, you get 500 kernels back in harvest, right?\n\nNo.  What would be the point of that?\n\nNo, you get one or two full ears of kernels per plant.  Each of those ears will have around 800 kernels.  That means if you sow 500 kernels, and each of them grows, you’ll get 1,000 times back what you put in.\n\nThe harvest is always much more than the planting.  You reap more than you sow.\n\nThe old preachers used to say:\n\n> Sin will take you farther than you want to go, keep you longer than you want to stay, and cost you more than you want to pay.\n\nThe prodigal never imagined he’d be eating out of hog troughs. Lot never imagined he’d be having children with his own daughters, hiding out in a cave.  Judas never imagined he’d be trading the life of Jesus for a little silver.  \n\nSo many men never imagined they wouldn’t be welcome at their kids graduation because they sowed the seeds of adultery and ruined their family.  Nobody ever imagined they’d be roaming the streets begging for $7 for a hit of heroine because they sowed the seeds of addiction.  Or sitting behind bars because they sowed the seeds of drunkeness and got behind the wheel of a car and killed someone.\n\nBut these things happen EVERY day.  You reap what you sow.  You reap later than you sow.  You reap more than you sow.\n\nThis same principle, can be put to work for good.  Sow godliness and you won’t believe the harvest.  You won’t be able to fathom it.  Life everlasting and most often blessings on this earth too.\n\nCan you imagine the blessings of getting to heaven and hearing “well done, thou good and faithful servant?”  Can you imagine getting crowns from your Lord for your good work here on this earth?\n\nCan you imagine meeting the folks in heaven who were saved because of your testimony and your sharing the gospel?\n\nMost people have never heard of Edward Kimbell.  He was just a lowly Sunday school teacher.  But Edward Kimbell took the time to lead a young worker boy named D. L. Moody to the Lord, just sowed a little seed.  Can you imagine the harvest Edward Kimbell will reap in heaven.\n\nDo you want to be the parent that is called blessed? That is remembered for your steadfast godliness?  \n\nYou’ve got to sow the right seed.  \n\nYou reap what you sow, you reap later than you sow, you reap more than you sow.\n\n# The Applications\n\nNow, back in our text.  What applications did Paul mean when he introduced this principle of sowing and reaping?  There are two of them in these verses.\n\n## First, Paul meant for us to apply this verse to our living.\n\nThat’s why in verse 8 he talks about sowing to the flesh or sowing to the Spirit.\n\nThe law of Sowing and Reaping should be applied to your life.  To your choices.  What you do today has consequences tomorrow.  The boomerangs gonna come back.  You reap what you sow.\n\nSome of you have some repenting to do, because you have been sowing some bad stuff.  You’ve been letting bad thoughts fester in your head.  You’ve been letting bad habits creep into your life.  \n\n> *“Be not deceived.  God is not mocked.”*. \n\nYou aren’t going to be the guy who beats the law of sowing and reaping.  You aren’t going to be the exception.\n\nWhat are you sowing in your life?  Are you sowing faithfulness?  Are you sowing right priorities? Are you sowing godliness?\n\nOr are you sowing carnality?  Are you sowing sin?\n\nLet’s apply this principle to our life.  Because what we sow will result in a harvest.\n\n## Second, Paul meant for us to apply this verse to our giving.\n\nThat’s actually the main point of the context.  These verses come in passages about bearing burdens and about taking care of the preacher (verses 1-6) and then verse 10 says:\n\n> *As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.*\n\nWhen you give - you aren’t throwing your money away.  You are investing it in a spiritual harvest.\n\nYou can’t outgive God.  You know that. \n\nThis week, someone reached out to me for some help.  I didn’t really have time to help him.  I had my own problems.  But he was a Christian, doing something for the right reason and he genuinely needed some help and I could help him so I did.  \n\nI’m not saying this to toot my own horn.  I’ve failed this test plenty of times.  I’m telling you this because that person turned around and sent me more than 10x what I would have charged him to help him, just when I needed it.  \n\nIt was just a reminder that you can’t outgive God.  That Patch the Pirate song says \n\n> Give to others and you’ll never lack.  Plant some good and your good will come back.\n\nWhat good are you planting today?  What are you doing now that your future self will thank you for?\n\nIt’s not karma, it’s the law of reaping and sowing.  Let’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "# The nature of law and grace (James 2:8-13)\nI want you to take your Bibles with me tonight and turn to James 2.  Our text tonight is going to be verses 8 through 13.\n\nAs you are turning there, I have to tell you that it’s been a long time since I’ve preached on a text that made my brain hurt as much as this one does.  I mean, I read this text early in the week, and I read every commentary I could get my hands on about this text, and it just wasn’t clicking.  I felt like I was in physics class or calculus or something.  \n\nLast week, I preached on being a “respecter of persons,” which basically means partiality or prejudice.  We talked about the rich person and the poor person who enter a church, and one gets treated well while the other gets treated poorly.  It could happen anywhere.  It could happen here.\n\nAnd it seems like such a little thing.  Everyone is partial, right?  Everyone has a little prejudice.  No big deal, right?\n\nBut the book of James makes a huge deal about it.  The book of James gives almost 13 verses to this topic of partiality or prejudice.  God absolutely despises this sin, and it is absolutely contrary to the character of God.  \n\nIt’s not just cultural.  It’s not just human nature.  It’s not something to be winked at, swept under the rug, and not discussed in polite company.  God hates the stuff.\n\nThat’s what we covered last week.  God hates partiality.  Partiality is against God’s nature.  When we show partiality, we are showing our own wicked and sinful motivations.\n\nSo let’s pick up where we left off last week and see where the book of James is going to take this because it gets really deep, but it is also really practical. \n\n> *”8 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well: 9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. 10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all. 11 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. 12 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty. 13 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.”*\n\nThere is a complicated argument in these verses.  It’s pretty deep.  James is talking about partiality and how bad it is to be partial or to be prejudiced. Likely what these people are doing when they read this is making excuses for themselves, saying things like:\n\n* That’s just the way I was raised.\n* You don’t know how bad that guy smelled.\n* This is just human nature.\n* Partiality isn’t really that big of a deal.\n\nSo James takes this, and he uses it to make a point about the nature of sin and salvation.  \n\nNow to help us understand what is happening in these verses, I’ve broken it down into three statements.  I show you how those statements tie to the text. \n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll jump right in to that.**\n\nThe first point James is making here is:\n\n## 1. When you break even a little bit of the law, you break the whole thing.\n\nPartiality may seem like a little thing, but it’s still breaking the law.  James likens it to adultery and murder.  \n\nIt’s not like bowling pins. It’s like a window.  When you break a law, the others aren’t left standing.  When you break one law, the whole law shatters.\n\n## 2. There is no grace in the law and no law in grace.\n\nIf I choose to be judged by my works, I’m condemned.  Period.\n\nIf I choose to be judged by grace, there are no works in it.  Period.\n\n## 3. If you’ve chosen grace, then give grace to others.",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me and turn to Acts 18. Acts 18 we are going to look at the second half of this chapter. I took the week off from Acts last Sunday. Mainly because I got to this passage and had no idea where to go with it. You'll see why in a second.\n\nIf you remember, in the beginning of Acts 18 the apostle Paul starts the church in Corinth and he stays there a long time. He has freedom there. Protection there. God enables him to write several books of the Bible there. But Paul moved on, and the last half of this chapter tells us what happens next. It covers A LOT. In fact, Paul does more traveling in these 10 verses than he has done in his whole missionary journey. There is a lot of work going on here. It's easy to get lost in the details.\n\nLet's read Acts 18 verse 18-28.\n\n\"And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.\"\n\n\"And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.\"\n\nIntroduction: Overview of the chapter.\nOk, like I said, there is just a ton of stuff going on in this passage. Lots of details. If you can just hang with me on those details for 3 minutes I'll get to what the mean. But we have to trudge through this first.\n\nThe church at Ephesus is founded.\nIt just sort of very quickly gives us two very important pieces of history. The church at Ephesus was probably the most significant church in New Testament times. Everybody spent time in Ephesus - Peter, John, Paul, Appolos. It kind of became the center of the early church for awhile. Here it tells us how the Ephesus church was started.\n\nPaul had wanted to go to Ephesus before he got his \"macedonian call\" but God had stopped him from going there and sent him to Macedonia and Greece instead. But in this passage Paul is leaving Corinth and traveling by boat back to Jerusalem and he just stops over in Ephesus for awhile.\n\nThe reason why Paul was going to Jerusalem is really interesting. In fact, that's what most of the material that has been written on this passage talks about. The text says he vowed a vow and he had to go to Jerusalem. Jewish people would sometimes voluntarily vow vows, shave their head and then burn the hair in Jerusalem. So that is what Paul is doing here.\n\nApparently, he was so overjoyed in what God had done in Corinth that he wanted to do something to show his gratitude to God so, being a Jew, he did the most jewish thing he could think of and took a temporary Nazarite vow. So that's kind of the back story. As weird as it sounds to us, he has to get to Jerusalem with this hair.\n\nOk. So on his way back he takes his new friends, Aquila and Prescilla and leaves them in Ephesus and heads to Jerusalem. Then he goes around to some of the churches he started with Barnabas and checks on them.\n\nSo the first part of this story is God using Paul to start the Ephesian church an then Paul takes off.\n\nApollos starts serving God.\nBut verses 24 through 28 tell the second major thing that happens in this story. This is just as significant to the early church. Apollos starts preaching Jesus.\n\nVerse 24 introduces us to this guy. It tells us he was from Alexandria. Alexandria was the second biggest city in the world at the time. It's in modern day Egypt. So Apollos is from Alexandria and it says he was an eloquent man. That could mean two things: It could mean he was well spoken or it could mean he was well educated. It probably means both. The third thing it says about him was that he was mighty in the scriptures. So Apollos knew his Bible - really, really well. And Apollos comes to Ephesus.\n\nApparently, Apollos is a believer. He already believes in Jesus. But Apollos doesn't really know much about Jesus at this point. He just knows what John the Baptist said about him and nothing more. So Apollos goes to the jewish synagogue and is preaching there and Aquila and Priscilla (remember, they were left there by Paul) hear him and they are like \"We've got to have this guy over for supper.\"\n\nSo they pull Apollos to the side and they sort of fill in the gaps in Apollos learning. They tell him the rest of the story. They bring him from John the Baptist to the present day.\n\nThen Apollos feels called to go to Corinth and the Christians give him a letter that says \"Listen to this guy\" and off he goes.\n\nThat's where the chapter ends.\n\nSo you've got a lot of events in this story, but you have three different characters. Paul, Apollos, and Aquila and Priscella (we are going to lump them together.) They are all just going about their life and God is using them. God is teaching them.\n\nSo what I want to do this morning is just focus on these people. These characters. I want to give you three points:\n\nwhat was different about these people.\nwhat was the same about these people.\nwhat was important about these people.\nLet's pray and we'll jump into that.\n\nThe first thing we are going to look at is:\n\n1. What was different about these people.\nRemember - we have three characters Paul, Apollos, and Aquila and Priscilla and all three of these are totally different.\n\nNotice,\n\nA. They had different backgrounds.\nPaul was a former pharisee. A jew from Galatia that studied under the feet of the most famous jew of his day. A man who persecuted Christians until God saved him on the Emmaus road.\n\nAquila and Priscilla were Christian tent makers from Italy who were pushed out by persecution. As far as we know they never lived in Palestine or anywhere but Italy before chapter 17 and it's very possible that Priscilla was a gentile.\n\nApollos was from the big city of Alexandria where he studied the scriptures hard and apparently had had no contact with other Christians.\n\nSo the point is these three or four people all came from different walks of life. They all were very different.\n\nNotice second that:\n\nB. They had different positions.\nPaul was a apostle. Apollos was an outsider who became a popular itinerant preacher. Aquila and Priscilla were tentmakers who, as far as we know, never had any kind of formal position in the church.\n\nNotice third that:\n\nC. They had different talents.\nPaul was the great starter and theologian. He was a good writer and a bold evangelist.\n\nAppolos was the mighty preacher. He would go on to be one of the most looked up to preachers in the early church.\n\nAquila and Priscilla were the encouragers. They encouraged Paul in the beginning of the chapter - here they are encouraging Apollos. Apparently, they were really good teachers too.\n\nThe last thing to notice is:\n\nD. They were at different stages of development.\nMost people think that Apollos was saved here - but he had almost no details. In fact, he didn't even know about baptism. He was at an early stage.\n\nThen you have Paul. It's interesting that Paul - who would later write so much about how unnecessary the Jewish religion is in the age of Christ - is so scrupulous here in observing a Jewish vow and taking his shaved hair to the temple. You could say that Paul was probably growing still at this point.\n\nThen you have Aquila and Priscilla who were mature enough in their faith to feel comfortable helping Apollos with his doctrine.\n\nThey were all at different stages.\n\nO.K. Pastor. What's the point?\n\nThe point is simple. We have a church here full of people who have different backgrounds. Some of you came from decent Christian families. Some of you came from families where your parents never darkened the door of a church. Some of you are pastor's kids. Some of you are the kids of the town drunk. Some of you are Mattooners from day one, some of you come from other parts of the country.\n\nYou have different positions. Some of you have formal areas of responsibility in the church. Some are deacons or preachers or teachers. Many of you don't but are looking to serve God however you can.\n\nYou have different talents. Did you know that when you got saved you got spiritual gifts. Every saved person has a spiritual gift to be used in the ministry. You also have god-given talents. Your talents are probably different than mine.\n\nAnd do you know what? You are at different stages of development. Some of you have been saved and walking with God for years. Some of you are newly saved and still learning the basics. Some of you need to be saved yet. You are at different stages.\n\nWhat really matters in this story isn't what was different about these people, it is...\n\n2. What was the same about these people.\nNotice that...\n\nA. They served the same God.\nPaul was following God to Corinth. Aquilla and Pricilla were following God to Corinth. They followed God together to Ephesus. Apollos follows the leadership of God to go back to Corinth to preach. God is just leading all over this story.\n\nSometimes we can get competitive as Christians. It's good to remember that we are on the same team. We are serving the same God. If another church in town is doing well - praise God. If another Christian in our church gets to teach a Sunday School class we wanted to teach - praise God.\n\nRomans 14:4 says:\n\n\"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.\"\n\nWhat matters is we are all serving God.\n\nNotice secondly that:\n\nB. They shared the same Truth.\nPaul is going around preaching. Apollos is \"shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.\" Aquilla and Priscilla are expounding the way of God more perfectly.\n\nIN every case - do you know what they are doing? They are preaching and teaching the Bible.\n\nIt's interesting here - but Aquilla and Priscilla aren't preachers. Not like we think of it. But they still knew the Bible. They still talked about the Bible and taught the Bible.\n\nListen church - let's be known as BIG B Bible baptist church. I'm a baptist. I believe in the baptist distinctive. But I'm a BIBLE baptist.\n\nWhen is the last time you were sitting around the dinner table and had a discussion about the Bible? Huh? When is the last time you talked about a passage of scripture with your friends?\n\nLook, you can talk about Football or Crocheting or old cars till you are blue in the face but you can't have a conversation about the scriptures - about the truth?\n\nWhat brings us together isn't out background. It isn't our shared history. It isn't our skin color or our politics. It's the fact that we serve the same master and we share the same Truth.\n\nNotice third that...\n\nC. They were part of the same work.\nPaul is preaching in the synagogues about Jesus. Aquila and Priscilla are preaching at the kitchen table about Jesus. Apoloos is publically convincing the jews about Jesus. It's clear that all of these people took the work of the great commission seriously.\n\nEven Aquila and Priscilla, who were \"just\" tent makers - were serious about spreading the gospel.\n\nOne more thing:\n\nD. They preached the same message.\nI've already touched on this but every one of them preached the gospel. Every one of them told others about Jesus. They were serving the same God, reading the same Bible, throwing themselves into the same mission and preaching the same message.\n\nSo, again - what do we learn from this?\n\nI think the main thing we need to learn is that we are all on the same team and that God has something for each of us to do. Hold you finger here and turn to Romans 12.\n\nLook at verses 1-2\n\n\"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\"\n\nListen, you may be asking \"What does God want from me?\" The answer is everything. He wants you to be a living sacrifice. To live for the will of God. This passage says that that is your \"reasonable service.\"\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Look at verses 3-8\n\n\"For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office: So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.\"\n\nIt's simple really - God wants you to give your life to Him and work for His will. That's the what. But it goes on to tell us the where. We are to do it through the church. We are to do it as members - as body parts - in God's church.\n\nWe are all on the same team, and we are all different. Just like body parts are different but all working together we should be too.\n\nListen - there are no dead weight body parts. Every part has a job. You may not be a preacher like Paul and Apollos were. But you can be an Aquila or a Priscilla.\n\nLet me quickly give you the last main point.\n\nWe've talked about what was different about these people and what was the same. Let's look lastly at:\n\n3. What was important about these people:\nThe most important thing to understand about this passage is this: Paul, Apollos, Aquila and Priscilla were not the main characters - God was. God was the prime mover in this story.\n\nSo what was important here:\n\nA. God was working in their lives.\nGod was working in the life of Paul - God wanted to set up a church in Ephesus. But not in Paul's time. God had some business with him in Macedonia first.\n\nGod was working in the life of an Alexandrian orator named Apollos. God was going to use him mightily, but first, Apollos had to meet a couple of tent makers who would help him understand some things.\n\nGod was working in the life of a normal couple named Aquila and Priscilla. They were forced out of their home country. They were on the run from persecution. But God was working. God had some business for them encouraging an apostle in Corinth, then helping a preacher in Ephesus.\n\nDo you see the important thing here - it was that God was working in them. Do you see God working in your life?\n\nThe second thing that was important about them was:\n\nB. God was using them.",

    "body": "Tonight's story is a very, very applicable one. It teaches us one of the most important lessons in the Christian life. If you get tonights story - and you take it to heart - it can save you a lifetime of heartache. So I beg you to listen.\n\nIt's not a pretty story. It doesn't paint our hero in a very flattering light. It's not the kind of Bible story you tell your kids before bedtime. But it's a story that teaches a profound spiritual lesson that we all need to learn.\n\nLet's read our text and we'll break it down.\n\n\"[Gen 16:1-16 KJV] 1 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name [was] Hagar. 2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. 3 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. 4 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 5 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong [be] upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. 6 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid [is] in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. 7 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 8 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 9 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. 10 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. 11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou [art] with child, and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction. 12 And he will be a wild man; his hand [will be] against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren. 13 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him that seeth me? 14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, [it is] between Kadesh and Bered. 15 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name, which Hagar bare, Ishmael. 16 And Abram [was] fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.\"\n\nLet's not beat around the bush. Let's jump right in and address...\n\n1. The Crime\nAbram had a child with Sarai's handmaid.\n\nIt wasn't his idea. He probably had doubts about it. But He still did it.\n\nThey were getting old - really old. Sarai was past the point of having kids. Desperation was setting in. So Sarai comes to Abram and says \"I've got a fix for this. You can have a child with my maiden - Hagar.\" And Abram says \"OK.\" And the deed is done.\n\nAt no point do they seek God's will on this. At no point to they get God's permission for this. They just go out and do it. They take matters into their own hands and they make a big, big mess.\n\nSo let's look at that mess for a second. Let's look at...\n\n2. The Consequences\nThis one little act of sin, had all kinds of unforseen consequences.\n\nI had a preacher growing up who used to say all the time:\n\nSin takes you farther than you want to go. Sin costs more than you want to pay. Sin keeps you longer than you want to stay.\n\nThat same preacher ended up cheating on his wife, ruining his good name, losing the respect of his kids and grandkids, splitting a church into a million pieces, and tearing at least two families apart. I wish he listened to his own preaching.\n\nBut here Abram is going to learn this lesson. Let me give you four consequences he faces:\n\nA. Family life is torn apart.\nIt all starts so innocent - it's Sarai's suggestion. But oh how it spirals out of control.\n\nAs soon as Hagar has conceived there is this hatred between Hagar and Sarai. Hagar get's proud.\n\nOne preacher said \"Maybe Hagar started smirking and rubbing her belly everytime that Sarai came into the room.\" It's a mess.\n\nSo What does Sarai do? She loses it! First, she get's mad at Abram. She goes to him and says \"My wrong be upon thee.\" In other words she says \"This is all your fault!\" It may have been my idea - but it's your fault. Huh?\n\nSo Abram says to Sarai - ok. We blew it. Do whatever you want with Hagar and I'll back you up.\n\nSo Sarai goes to Hagar and just really lets her have it. The Bible says Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face\n\nSo now Abram has a pregnant second wife who is running away and an angry and vengful first wife who is mad at him.\n\nHis family life is in tatters.\n\nThe second consequence is...\n\nB. A young girl and her son's life is ruined.\nHagar isn't faultless in this story. She was proud to Sarai. But she's definitely the victim here. In this culture, she didn't have much say so in the thing. Now, she's damaged goods. She's bearing a son who will be a second rate son. She's got the lady of the house (and her boss) extremely mad at her.\n\nYou would run away too. Thats what people do when they are being mistreated and she was definitely mistreated and her family and her hopes were ruined.\n\nBut I also want to mention the third consequence:\n\nC. A race is born that is still causing problems today.\nIshmael became the father of the Arab race. Really, more than any other people group, the Arab race is still causing problems today.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean God can't save Arabic people. It doesn't mean that they aren't the mission field. It just means that God's chosen people - the jews - and the arabs have a special hate for each other and the whole thing could have been avoided were it not for this seemingly innocent sin in Genesis 16.\n\nSo that's the consequences. They are huge.\n\nLet's look at...\n\n3. The Causes\nI think the natural question is: What caused all of this?\n\nHow could Abram go from the tower of faith we see in chapters 14 and 15 to the mess we see in chapter 16?\n\nI mean, in chapter 14 he's battling the armies and talking to Malchizedek. In chapter 15 he's communing with God and establishing a covenant.\n\nIn chapter 16, he's having a relationship God never intended for him to have and a child God never intended for him to have.\n\nWhat happened? There are a lot of causes for this miss but let me give you three of them:\n\nA. Capitulation of leadership.\nLook at verse 2:\n\n\" 2 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai\"\n\nAbraham was supposed to be the spiritual leader of his household. But here he just says \"Yes dear.\" He doesn't take a stand. He lets Sarai make the decisions and run the show and he pays the consequences.\n\nNone of this would have happened had Abraham had the backbone to stand up to his wife.\n\nNow, I want to be clear - men, we ought to listen to our wives. But it is our responsablity to provide spiritual leadership in the home and when our wives are suggesting something outside of God's will we have to say no. That's not right. We aren't doing that.\n\nEphesians 5:22-23 says:\n\n\"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\"\n\nAbraham failed to take spiritual leadership here and he paid dearly for it.\n\nA second cause is:\n\nB. Worldly thinking.\nNotice what Sarai says to Abram:\n\n\"I pray thee, go in unto my maid,: it may be that I may obtain children by her.\"\n\nWhat Sarai was suggesting was that she have children by proxy. Legally, Hagar's child was going to be her child.\n\nNow, where do you think she got this idea? The law of the land at that time was called \"The code of Hamarabi\" and we can still read it today and it references a situation just like this. So probably a big part of this was \"Everybodies doing it.\" It was worldly thinking.\n\nListen folks, our morality cannot come from the world. It has to come from God's word. Our world sees nothing wrong with homosexuality. It sees nothing wrong with premarital sex. It sees nothing wrong with a little lying. It sees nothing wrong with... fill in the blank. But we aren't children of this world - we are citizens of heaven and our morality is God's morality.\n\nSo run from worldly thinking because it will hurt you.\n\nOne more cause and probably the main cause was:\n\nC. Lack of faith.\nHere is what it came down to - Sarai and Abraham both showed a lack of faith in God's ability and intentions to do what God said He was going to do. They said in their hearts \"God, I know you said we would be the parents of many nations - but that is impossible, so you must mean we should...\"\n\nIt was a lack of faith. God did what God always planned to do. Isaac was born to Sarai - not to Hagar or anyone else. God always wanted it to be a miracle. But Abraham and Sarai didn't believe.\n\nWe've looked at both the causes and the consequences of this sin. But I want us to look at it agian and think about...\n\n4. The Cautions\nIn other words - what can we learn from this little episode that will keep us from similar sins? I've got four things:\n\nFirst,\n\nA. If you claim to be sinless, you are delusional.\nGenesis and Romans both say about Abraham \"and he believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness.\" In other words, Abraham's righteousness wasn't an earned righteousness, it was an imputed righteousness. Abraham isn't the father of faith because he was sinlessly perfect - he's the father of faith because he trusted God and God's sacrifice for Him. He looked forward to the cross of Christ just as we look back at it and it was his faith in God's sacrifice that saved him.\n\nThere are people who teach that if you trust Christ and you are really saved - you are going to live perfectly. The flesh is dead. The old man is dead. And if you sin, you have to get saved all over again. I'd like for them to tell that to Abraham - because that's not what we see here. We see Abram believing God and God stamping him with righteousness but that doesn't mean that Abram lived sinlessly from that point forward.\n\nF.B. Meyer - a preacher from the 1800s wrote this about the story. Speaking of the old man he said:\n\nIt is absurd to say that it dies once for all in some early stage of the Christian life; and it is perilous to lead men to think so. When men think or boast that it is dead, it peeps out in their very assertions, and laughs at the success of its efforts to blind them to its presence. This is the masterpiece of its art: to cajole its dupes into thinking that it is dead. Bands of thieves always like to secure the insertion of a paragraph in the newspapers, announcing that they have left the neighborhood, because in the false security which is induced by the announcement, they are more able to carry out their plans of pillage.\n\nEvery one of these guys sinned. They weren't perfect. You won't be either. That's not an excuse. We should still try to live perfectly. But if you think you are on some kind of spiritual high ground you are deluding yourself and are about to fall off a spiritual cliff.\n\nAlong these same lines - this story is a warning that:\n\nB. Even the best people have problems.\nHebrews 11:11 says:\n\n\"Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.\"\n\nSara is given to us as an example of faith! And Sara, on this very issue, made a huge mess in Genesis 16.\n\nListen folks, this story of ours isn't the story of a bunch of heroic people boldly and faithfully serving God - it's the story of a bunch of broken people feebly and weakly using the little bit of faith that they have and God reaching way out to make up the distance.\n\nYou may make a mistake. No. Write it down. You will. When it happens dust yourself off, repent of it, ask God for forgiveness and keep following him.\n\nGetting to the point, a third caution is:\n\nC. Don't get ahead of God's will. (His timetable isn't yours.)\nGod wanted Abraham to have a son. God just didn't want Abraham to have a son yet. Abraham jumped ahead. He took a spiritual shortcut and paid the price for it.\n\nListen, if you don't learn anything else from this lesson learn this lesson. Please. Don't run ahead of God. I've seen this happen so many times.\n\nSome young person thinks \"I know God wants me to have a wife or a husband\" and they start to get desperate and...five years later they aren't in church. You know it. You've seen it.\n\nSome father thinks \"I know God wants us to be financially taken care of\" and he gets desperate so he goes and makes a stupid move and puts his family in jeopardy.\n\nI know a guy who was maneuvering to become a pastor and it just wasn't time yet. He tried to force it and now he's not even in church. He made a mess.\n\nDavid didn't get to be king after he killed Goliath - God made him wait for a really long time afterwards. Moses didn't deliver his people when he killed that Egyptian. He still had 40 years in the wilderness.\n\nSometimes - it's easier for us to hear \"no\" than it is for us to hear \"wait\" but God still says \"wait\" to us quite often.\n\nHis ways are perfect and His timing is perfect. So don't rush it. Don't force it.\n\nAlong these same lines is this last warning:\n\nD. Don't do God's work in your flesh. (His ways aren't yours.)\nGod wanted Abram to have a son - just not that way. Not with Hagar. God wanted him to have a son God's way. Abram tried to go out and force God's will to come to pass faster and he made a mess.\n\nDon't try to force God's will. Don't try to manipulate God's will. Don't try to make God's will happen in the flesh.\n\nSo many church splits happen because somebody is trying to make what they think is God's will happen in the flesh. Just trust God. Just follow Him.\n\nThat is the main lesson from this story but I want to give you one more point. I don't want to leave you on a sour note.\n\nWrite down...\n\n5. The Consolation - God is merciful.\nI love how this story ends. Hagar runs from Sarai. She's broken. She's down. Her life is ruined.\n\nAnd the angel of the Lord meets her at a well and gives her this promise:\n\n\"I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.\"\n\nThen in verse 11 He says \"Thou shalt call his name Ishmael; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.\"\n\nIshmael means \"God hears.\"\n\nThey made a mess of things. And it's easy to look at this story and just chew Hagar up. But God looked at Hagar with compassion and heard her cries and had mercy on her.\n\nWe have a great God you know that? Let's trust Him. Don't run ahead of Him. Don't try to do His work in the flesh. Just trust Him. It's not easy - but the consequences of not doing it are so, so severe.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "Turn with me to James 5.  We are almost through James.  Next week a missionary will be speaking, so the week after will be our last in James.\n\nTonight’s passage is all about the power of prayer. But this isn’t really about the power of individual prayer - although it touches on that - it’s about the power of church prayer.  \n\nHudson Taylor used to say “the church moves forward on it knees.”  I can say that the times when God has really shown up here and moved in a mighty way, it’s always been tied to a time of urgent prayer.  Some of you were saved after seasons of urgent prayer.  \n\nPrayer is one of the most important things we do as a church.  \n\nLet’s get into our text.  Let’s read verses 13-18 tonight.\n\n> *”13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. 14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: 15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. 16 Confess [your] faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. 17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. 18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.”*  (Jas 5:13-18 KJV)\n\nAll throughout the book of James, James has been warning us about the danger of our tongue.  \n\nWay back in chapter 1 James says \n\n> *”If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but decieveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain”* (26)\n\nIn chapter two he warns us about using our tongue to show respect of persons.  Later on, in verse 16, he warns us about using our tongue to make empty Christian statements when we have the power to help people.  \n\nThen chapter 3 is all about the tongue.  It talks about how the tongue is an unquenchable fire.  An untamable beast.\n\nIn chapter 4:11 James warns us against using our tongue to speak evil of our brother and or to judge our brothers.\n\nFinally, in this chapter we’ve been warned against using our tongues to grudge and complain against our brothers and sisters in Christ (9), and about using them to make silly oaths. (12)\n\nSo James has a consistent warning in this book: Watch your tongue.  It gets you in trouble.  It hurts your walk with God.  It hurts others.\n\nBut He doesn’t just leave us with a **warning** about the tongue, he gives us instruction for how we are supposed to use the tongue.\n\nThe first point I want to give you tonight is…\n\n## 1. The Recipe for Prayer (13-14)\n\n### A. For the suffering\n\nNotice it says *”Is any among you afflicted? let him pray.”*\n\nIf you are suffering, you should bring your suffering to the Lord.  Take it to Jesus.  \n\nLike the old song says \n\n``` markdown\nAre you weary, are you heavyhearted?\nTell it to Jesus,\nTell it to Jesus;\nAre you grieving over joys departed?\nTell it to Jesus alone.\n```\n\nThat’s what James is saying, when you are going through a hard time, don’t complain, don’t murmur, don’t hold grudges, use that tongue and share it with God.  Pray about it.\n\n1 Peter 5:7 says *”Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you”*\n\nLook at the second piece of advice James gives us regarding our tongue:\n\n## B. For the happy\n\nHe says *”Is any merry? let him sing psalms.”*\n\nWhat he’s saying is, if you are struggling, pray about it.  If you are happy, sing to God about it.  \n\nNotice, that both of these are forms of God-directed speech.  When we are struggling we direct our speech to God in prayer, when we are joyful we direct our speech to God in song.\n\nOne interesting thing here is that the words “to sing songs” here is the greek word for strumming or picking.  I’d say this is talking about congregational music.  Singing with accompaniment.\n\nI’ve told you many times that our singing together is powerful.  It’s an important part of our worship together.  Remember Ephesians 5:19, right after we are told to be filled with the spirit we are told to:\n\n> *”Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;”*\n\nThats a corporate thing.  That’s a church wide thing.\n\nI really hope you have good, God-honoring Christian music in your life.  Music has the ability to lift up your soul and direct your spirit.  Just this morning I was reading in my devotions about king Saul being depressed and David would come in and play music for him and it would lift up his spirit.  Music can do that.\n\nI also think bad music, worldly music, can really hamper your Christian walk and Christian growth.  Your music is a reflection of what is in your heart.  So choose good music and sing that good music back to God.\n\nSo don’t use your tongue to gripe, to complain, to backbite, to say silly things.  Use your tongue to pray to God or use your tongue to sing to God.\n\nOne more recipe here for prayer and that is…\n\n### C. For the sick\n\nVerse 14 says:\n\n> *”Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:”*\n\nJames says that when we are sick, we can call on the elders of the church, the church leadership, to come and pray over us and anoint us with oil.\n\nMy daughter asked a few weeks ago “What’s the deal with the oil?  Why do we anoint people with oil and pray over them.”\n\nMy answer was simple, because the Bible tells us to.  That’s really the reason why we do it.\n\nNow, what does the oil mean?  There are two theories I found as I was studying this out:\n\nThe first theory is that the oil was used as a kind of medicine.  Olive oil was a pretty common cure in Bible times.  \n\nI understand that.  But the problem I have with that explanation is that it doesn’t say “have them drink olive oil” or “administer olive oil medicinally”.  It says “anoint them” which just means “pour on” or “wipe on.”  That’s not a medicinal treatment here.\n\nThe second theory and the one that I think is right is that it is just a picture of the Holy Spirit and a tactile reminder of the power of prayer.  We don’t believe there is anything magical about the oil - it’s just olive oil - same kind you cook with.  We don’t believe it turns into something else when we use it this way - we are just being obedient to a command in the scripture.\n\nSo, if you are sick, you can call for the church leaders to come and pray over you.  Now, look, it doesn’t say we have to do this in the church.  We can do this in your home.  We can do this at a hospital room. But it does say that the sick person needs to initiate it.  \n\nDon’t be bashful about asking for prayer.\n\nSo that’s the first thing, that’s the recipe for prayer.  Point number two is…\n\n## 2. The Results of Prayer (15-16)\n\nIn verses 15-16 it tells us what can happen when we pray in faith.  \n\nFirst,\n\n### A. Healing will happen \n\nIt says…\n\n> *”And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up;”*\n\nWhen we pray together over people, God can and sometimes does heal them.  This is a powerful promise from God.\n\nMatthew 18:19-20 says:\n\n> *”Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”*\n\nI don’t think this is to be taken as a promise that God heals every sickness.  We certainly see times in the New Testament where there was sickness and the answer wasn’t “have God heal you” or “go to the healing service.”  But we can’t discount this either.\n\nI don’t believe that anyone in our church has the gift of healing, but I absolutely still believe that God has the power to heal and I absolutely believe that He sometimes uses that power to \n\n### B. Forgiveness will happen \n\n> *”and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.”*\n\nThis isn’t talking about saving faith here, it’s talking about a connection between sickness and sin.\n\nThe Bible teaches that sometimes, we get sick because of sin.  Not always, but sometimes.  \n\n### C. Confession *can* happen \n\n> *”Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.”*\n\n## 3.

And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our embers, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.”*\n\nMy papa is an old Mainer.  He lived in Boston most of his life, but his heart was always in Maine.  My great-grandparents and my grandparents had several acres in the country in West Newbury, Maine. I have a lot of memories going up there and picking wild blueberries and doing a whole lot of nothing because there is nothing to do in Maine.\n\nOne thing I remember clearly is my papa telling me a story about how a fire wiped out all of southern Maine.  I couldn’t believe it.  It was called the Great Maine Fire, and all the old Mainers would talk about it.\n\nTwo years ago, a couple of teenagers were playing on a mountain I’ve hiked—the Chimney Tops 2 Mountain outside of Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  They threw a match, thinking it was funny, and started a small fire on top of the mountian.  What they didn’t know was that the mountains there were dryer than they had ever been after four months with no rain, and that because there hadn’t been a forest fire in 80 years, there was 80 years’ worth of fuel to burn.\n\nA freak windstorm with gusts up to 100 miles per hour blew that fire on the mountain towards Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, and the results were awful.  Fire took over one of the most popular vacation spots in the country.  Thousands of people lost their homes and their businesses; hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage; hundreds of injuries and fourteen people died.\n\nI don’t use a lot of pictures, but look at these for a minute. \n\nTwo kids playing with matches.  Every man in here stand up.  Stand up.  Now sit down if you’ve ever played with fire in your life.  That’s what I thought.\n\nFire is so commonplace, but fire can be unbelievably unpredictable and destructive.\n\nJames says that is what the tongue is like.  That is what our words are like—like a fire that burns out of control and does damage we can’t even imagine.  \n\nI’m going to preach tonight on James 3:2-12.  We are going to cover this whole section about the tongue, but as we read the text and as we go into the different things the Bible is teaching us, I don’t want you to forget these pictures.\n\nLet’s read the whole text, and then we’ll pray and get into the message:\n\n> *”James 3:2-12 (KJV) 2 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same [is] a perfect man, [and] able also to bridle the whole body. 3 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. 4 Behold also the ships, which though [they be] so great, and [are] driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. 5 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! 6 And the tongue [is] a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. 7 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: 8 But the tongue can no man tame; [it is] an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter? 12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.”*\n\nThe title of the message tonight is “The Power of the Tongue.”\n\nA little bit of gunpowder, a little metal tube, a little piece of lead—those things can start a world war that kills nearly a million people.   A tiny germ—something we can’t even see—carried by a mosquito can cause a nationwide plague.  The tiniest microchip, which is smaller than a quarter, now has hundreds of times the computing power of all the equipment that sent people to the moon.\n\nLittle things can be very, very powerful. The main idea of this passage is that your tongue is a little thing, but it’s insanely powerful and dangerous.\n\nSpecifically, James tells us that our tongue has the power to do three things.   \n\n***Let’s pray and I’ll give them to you.***\n\nThe first power that your tongue has is...\n\n## 1. The tongue has the power to direct.\n\nVerse 2 says that everyone offends.  The word “offends” there means “stumbles” or “slips up.”  Every one of us has times when we make mistakes and we sin.  A lot of times, our sin isn’t us deliberately trying to be evil; we just slip up and fall.\n\nBut James has a secret for us.  He says, *”If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.”*\n\nWhat James is saying here is that if you want to be a person who doesn’t slip up, who doesn’t stumble, who doesn’t sin—if you want to be a person who is in control—then control your tongue.\n\nIn other words: If you can keep this little thing under control, then you can keep your whole life under control.  \n\nJames uses the example of a bit, which is a tiny piece of metal that lets you control a huge horse.  He uses the example of a rudder, which is a tiny piece of wood that lets you steer a huge ship.\n\nThe idea is if you control your tongue, you control your life. On the flip side, if your mouth is out of control, your whole life is out of control.  \n\nNow why is that?  James doesn’t tell us here, but I think the Bible makes it pretty clear: Your tongue is directly tied to your heart.  Jesus said, *”For out of the heart the mouth speaketh.”*  \n\nHere is a scary truth: Nothing comes out of our mouths that isn’t first in our heart.  \n\nSometimes you’ll mess up, and you’ll say something that hurts someone’s feelings. You’ll be quick to say, “I didn’t mean it,” but yes, you did.  You might regret it, but if it wasn’t in your heart in the first place, then it wouldn’t come out of your mouth.\n\nThere is this super tight connection between the words we say and what is going on in our heart.\n\nProverbs 21:23 says:\n\n> *”Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.”*\n\nProverbs 18:21 says:\n\n> *”Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.”*\n\nSo direct your tongue and direct your life.  Focus on keeping this little thing under control, and you’ll keep your heart under control.\n\nThat’s the first point.  The second point James makes is one I’ve already covered a bit. It is...\n\n## 2. The tongue has the power to destroy.\n\nThe tongue is a fire and a world of iniquity.  It’s an untameable wild beast.\n\nIt is an unpredictable and wildly destructive force.  \n\nWars are caused by this little thing.  Genocides are caused by this little thing.  Billions are led astray by this little thing.\n\nLet’s get closer to where we live: Divorces are caused by this little thing.  Suicides are caused by this little thing.  Church splits are caused by this little thing.  This little thing inflicts wounds that some people never heal from.\n\nSome of you have tongues that are completely out of control.  You may say, “Well, that’s just the way I am.”  Well, that is no excuse.  Murderers can use that excuse.  Child molesters can use that excuse.  “Just the way you are” can destroy your church; it can destroy families; it can destroy friendships.  \n\nGossip, criticism, running your mouth, and making fun of people is not okay.  You are playing with fire on top of the mountain, and someday a gust of wind is going to blow through and cause damage you could never imagine. Then you are going to have to live with the fact that you caused it because you said, “That’s just the way I am,” and you ran your mouth.\n\nThe tongue can be a fire.  The tongue can be a poison.  The tongue has so much power to destroy.\n\nOne more thing…\n\n## 3. The tongue has the power to disclose.\n\nVerses 9-12 say:\n\n> *”9 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. 11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet [water] and bitter? 12 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so [can] no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.”*\n\nWhat James is saying is that your tongue tells on you.  You can try to hide who you really are, but your tongue is going to disclose it to the whole world.\n\nI had to do a research paper once on vocabulary. One of the things I learned is that it takes people just a few seconds to judge your intelligence, and most of what they go on is your vocabulary.  You can try to seem smart, but your tongue tells on you.\n\nRecently I was watching a program about the unabomber.  The unabomber went uncaught for decades.  The FBI had no clue.  They had no idea how to catch the guy.  Their big break came when he published a long manifesto in the newspapers.  There wasn’t any forensic evidence at all, but there were little tips they picked up from his vocabulary that gave them a much clearer picture of who he was, and that is how they cracked the case.\n\nYour words and your tongue tell on you.\n\nProverbs 17:27-28 says:\n\n> *”He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit. Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.”*\n\nEcclesiastes 10:3 says:\n\n> *”Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.”*\n\nYou can try to hide who you are, but your tongue is going to tell on you.  It’s going to disclose the thoughts of your heart.  It’s like you are walking around wearing a sandwich sign that says:\n\n> I’m corrupt.  I’m a fool.\n\nBut it can also go the other way.  Your words can say: \n\n> I’m a Christian.  I’m following God.  I’m filled with the Spirit.\n\nI’m going to wrap this up.  It’s going to be a super short message tonight.  But hear this:\n\nYour tongue is a fire, but you didn’t get here tonight without a fire.  We wouldn’t be able to see tonight without fire.  It’s our ability to harness little fires that gives us such power and technology that we have today.\n\nYour tongue is poison, but so is chemotherapy and so is most medicine if it’s taken incorrectly.\n\nMy point is this: You can’t preach the gospel without talking.  You can’t share the good news of Jesus without using the tongue.  We have a powerful thing here in our mouths, and under the control of the Holy Spirit, it can have a huge impact for God.  \n\nBut we have to know that the nature of it is to get out of control.  We have to know that most of our problems are tongue problems, and that those tongue problems come right from heart problems.  The old posters used to say, “Loose lips sink ships.”  I can tell you that loose lips sink friendships.  Loose lips sink families.  Loose lips destroy churches.\n\nGossip; making fun; criticism; meanness—You are dealing with fire there.  One of these days that fire is going to catch ahold and burn, and you will see damage you could never have imagined.\n\nSo I want you to use your tongue.  \n\n* Use your tongue as a steering wheel.  Control your tongue so you can control your life.\n* Use your tongue like a fire suppression system.  When bad stuff comes out, act fast.  \n* Use your tongue like a thermostat to gauge the spiritual temperature of your heart.\n\nAnd then use your tongue to preach the gospel, to share the Bible, to encourage and to pray for others.",

    "body": "Have you ever had to wait a really long time to get something, or at least it seemed like a long time? Maybe when you were a kid, there was this toy you really wanted, and you asked your parents for it over and over again. Then on your birthday or at Christmas, you open one of your presents, and there it is. Or maybe when you were a teenager, you couldn’t wait to have your own car. I think everybody remembers their first car. It’s a pretty big deal because you wanted one, and now it’s yours. Maybe there was this career you wanted to pursue, and you went through years of college and years of hard work until you finally got it. How do you feel when you finally get something you’ve waited a long time for? It’s just a feeling of pure joy.\n\nThat’s what we see here in the first part of Genesis 21. Abraham and Sarah had been waiting to have a son for decades. Sometimes it felt like they were never going to have a child of their own. They had tried to take some shortcuts along the way, but they didn’t give them what they really wanted. Now finally, when Abraham is 100 years old and Sarah is 90 years old, that child they so desperately longed for had arrived. It’s no wonder he was named Isaac, which means, “He laughs.” I can only imagine the sheer exhilaration those two parents must have felt. \n\nOf course, even the very best things can often bring about difficulties, as Pastor Hayden preached this morning. Abraham had a couple of messes of his own making he had to clean up over the course of this chapter as well. He experienced great joy here in this chapter, but he also has to deal with some heavy grief here. Abraham gained something, but he also had to let something go, which can be very difficult for us to do at times. I think his experiences here can help us in our own Christian lives as well, so I want to look at three important events in the life of Abraham that we see here in this chapter.\n\n1. The Promised Child (Genesis 21:1-7) – Look at the first two verses. “And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.” The birth of Isaac was the fulfillment of a promise God had made unto Abraham and Sarah. This was not merely a happy coincidence. This was the Lord keeping His word and doing something that only He could do. There was no way for Abraham and Sarah to have this child if God wasn’t in it. This was something supernatural, a miraculous birth. There could be no doubt about that. We talked a few weeks ago about the question God asked Sarah in Genesis 18: “Is anything too hard for the Lord?” Sarah had doubted before, but now there could be no doubt. He had proven that there was nothing too hard for Him. \n\nIt is good to know that we serve a God who can be trusted to keep His promises. Titus 1:2 says, “In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began.” The fact that the Lord cannot lie and keeps His promises is why the Bible ought to be so precious to us. Have you ever had someone promise to do something for you, but deep down, you had your doubts as to whether they would actually follow through on their commitment? With God, you don’t have to worry about that. We know that He will keep His Word. That is why we can have hope, because He is the One making and keeping the promise. He promised us eternal life if we would believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and so we know we have it if we have believed. It’s as simple as that. \n\nIt is encouraging for us to remember that God keeps His Word, no matter what. We can count on Him to do His part. We’ve got some unconditional promises, and He will keep them. They do not depend on us. It’s a good thing for Abraham and Sarah that the Lord giving them a son did not depend on how good they were, because they’d have never had Isaac. God unconditionally promised to give them a son, and they had a son, even in spite of their faults and failures. It’s great to know that God doesn’t use us as an excuse to break His promises. II Timothy 2:13 says, “If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.” We all have periods where we doubt, but the Lord abides faithful because it would be a complete denial of His own character if He did not. We can trust His promises because His very nature and character is wrapped up in those promises. \n\nThe faithfulness of God is the bedrock of our assurance. Most of us know John 3:16, which says, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” If you’ve believed in the Son of God, you have eternal life, period. Nothing can change that. Jesus says in John 10:28-29, “And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.” If your assurance is based on anything other than God’s Word, you’re going to struggle with doubt. I am glad that the keeping of my salvation does not depend on me, or I’d be in trouble. I can rest easy knowing that it depends on Him, and He will never fail me.\n\nBack in our text in Genesis 21, we see that Abraham was still mindful of his responsibility to the Lord. Verse 4 tells us that he circumcised Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Circumcision was the sign of the covenant that God gave to Abraham, and it was to be done eight days after a child was born. Isaac was the first one to be circumcised in the pattern of this covenant at eight days old. Abraham and Ishmael had been circumcised, but not at eight days old, of course. This was proof that Isaac was the one who would carry on the covenant after Abraham. Sometimes when God blesses us, we can become complacent. We let things slack a little bit here and there. I am glad to see Abraham did not fall into that trap. \n\n2. The Picture of Conflict (Genesis 21:9-21, Galatians 4:21-31) – After a while, Isaac is weaned, and Abraham throws a big party to celebrate. It was customary for children in those days in that culture to be weaned when they’re two or three years old, so that was probably the case here. Everything seemed to be going well, until Sarah spots Ishmael mocking and belittling the whole affair. She had taken Hagar back before, but she decided that this was the last straw. Sarah recognized that this was an untenable situation. She tells Abraham to cast out Hagar and Ishmael both because he would not be a joint heir with Isaac. \n\nFirst of all, this was not a prank played by a small child who didn’t know any better here. Abraham was 86 years old when Ishmael was born, and he was 100 years old when Isaac was born. Add a couple years to that, and Ishmael is around 16 years old at this point. He knew what he was doing. There must have been some resentment toward Isaac. He may have felt like he had been displaced by his birth. All of his hopes for an inheritance were shattered. That does not excuse his actions, but it might explain them. It is interesting to note that the Hebrew word for “mocking” in verse 9 comes from the same root word as Isaac’s name does. Abraham and Sarah experienced the laughter of joy at Isaac’s birth, but it resulted in the laughter of mockery from Ishmael. \n\nNaturally, this comes as a devastating blow to Abraham. He still had a father’s love toward Ishmael. However, God concurs with Sarah’s decision and tells him to listen to her advice in this instance because Isaac was the promised child, not Ishmael. However, the Lord eases his fears and worries by promising that He will make a great nation from Ishmael as well, so even though he would no longer be with Abraham, God would still be with him. He would not abandon him, because He had already promised this to Hagar and Abraham in Genesis 16 and 17. As we’ve discussed already, God always keeps His promises, so even when Hagar and Ishmael are out there struggling in the wilderness, He is still mindful of them and provides for them. The Lord’s provision doesn’t mean that life will always be easy, but it does mean that He will be there when we need Him. \n\nThe conflict between Sarah and Hagar, and Isaac and Ishmael, represents a conflict that we all face as Christians [Read Galatians 4:21-31]. Without denying its historical accuracy, Paul uses this event to make an allegory of the Christian life. Each of the four major people here are symbolic of something deeper. Sarah could not have understood the spiritual implications of the statement she made, but God uses Paul centuries later to make that connection.\n\nA. Hagar = Bondage to Sin and the Law – Hagar was a slave, so it makes sense that she represents slavery here. The Galatians were trying to add the works of the law to their justification, but Paul points out that the law only leads to bondage. No matter how many good works a person may try to perform, they will always come short of the glory of God because they will inevitably sin and fail. James 2:10 tells us, “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.” How many crimes does a person have to commit to be a criminal? Just one. How many laws do you have to break to be a lawbreaker? Just one. \n\nYou may think that just being a good person and trying your best will be enough to get you to heaven, but you’re wrong. We are all sinners by birth and by choice. Romans 6:23 tells us, “The wages of sin is death,” and that’s the bad news. The good news is in the second half of the verse, “But the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” That leads us to the next part.\n\nB. Sarah = Liberty in Jesus Christ – She is the wife of the covenant. When God made the covenant with Abraham in Genesis 17, He included Sarah and changed her name from Sarai. In like manner, when we trust Christ, we become part of His bride and a part of the promise. We are freed from the slavery of sin and the law. When Peter was confronting the Jewish Christians who were trying to impose circumcision upon the Gentile Christians, he said in Acts 15:10-11, “Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we shall be saved, even as they.” We are all equal in Christ, and we are all free in Christ. You don’t have to burden yourself by trying to attain to an impossible standard that you can never hope to meet. God offers grace to us, and He will break the shackles of sin. You don’t have to do anything to earn your way to heaven, and you can’t do anything to earn your way to heaven, but Christ has done it all already. There is freedom in Jesus, and it is being offered to whoever will take it. \n\nC. Ishmael = The Flesh – Ishmael was born as a result of Abraham and Sarah’s scheming and their own effort. He was a work of the flesh. His birth did not lead to lasting satisfaction. In the end, it ultimately brought about conflict with Isaac. The flesh cannot coexist with the things of God. It is unpalatable to the flesh. As Ishmael mocked Isaac, so the flesh despises spiritual things. Paul talks about this at length in Romans 7-8. In Romans 7:18, he says, “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwelleth no good thing.” In Romans 8:8, he says, “So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.” No matter how much you feel like you can accomplish in your own strength, it won’t be enough because we are still frail, sinful creatures. Left to ourselves, sin will eventually win out, but it doesn’t have to be that way.\n\nD. Isaac = The Spirit – Unlike Ishmael, Isaac’s birth was miraculous and could only be explained as a work of God. Nothing Abraham and Sarah could have done would have resulted in Isaac’s birth. Ishmael represents the first birth, the natural birth, but Isaac represents being born again, the spiritual birth. It is a miracle that God performs when we trust in His Son Jesus Christ. We receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, which seals us for heaven. \n\nHowever, that results in a problem. As I said before, the flesh cannot coexist with the Spirit. That leads to an internal conflict, which Paul follows up on in Galatians 5:16-17. “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.” If you’re saved, there’s a fight raging within you on a daily basis between your flesh, your old nature, and the Spirit, your new nature. \n\nThere’s an old Cherokee story that goes something like this. There was an old Cherokee telling his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He says, “My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us all. One is evil – It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. The other is good – It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.” The grandson thought about it for a minute, and then asked his grandfather, “Which wolf wins?” The old Cherokee simply replied, “The one you feed.” \n\nIt’s the same idea in the battle between the flesh and the Spirit. If you’re struggling with sin and failing to live for God, it’s because you’re feeding your flesh too much. It’s up to you to decide which one wins. That’s why we need to follow Sarah’s advice and cast out the things that are bringing us into that bondage. If we are saved, we don’t have to lose to sin. However, sometimes it is difficult to get rid of things that are hindering our Christian lives. We can get attached to them. It was difficult for Abraham to send Ishmael away. He was his son. However, to his credit, as soon as God told him what to do and he knew what he should do, he obeyed immediately. It says he rose up early in the morning, and he sent Hagar and Ishmael away. Even in the next chapter, when the Lord tells him to offer up Isaac, Abraham does the same thing. He rises up early in the morning and obeys immediately. \n\nThat’s the mentality we need to have about this. As soon as we recognize something is hindering our Christian lives, we need to get rid of it immediately. It may not be a bad thing in and of itself, but it can be a bad thing if it’s getting in the way of the Spirit ruling your life. It could be sports, music, the internet, video games, or some other form of entertainment where we prioritize feeding our flesh over feeding the Spirit. You may think you can handle it, but you’re failing. You may try to put it off because you’ve grown accustomed to it, and you’re comfortable with it. But if God puts His finger on it and says cast it out, then that’s what you need to do. Don’t put it off either. I’m sure if you ask the Lord what it is that’s hindering the Spirit’s work in your life, He’d tell you. However, some of us are afraid to ask because we’re afraid of what He’ll tell us. Don’t be afraid. God won’t ask you to do anything that isn’t ultimately for your good. You can trust Him.\n\n3. The Proposed Compromise (21:22-34) – We’ll just touch on this part briefly, and we’ll be done. At this point, Abimelech makes a return to the story. We met him in the last chapter when Abraham lied to him about Sarah being his wife. After a few years of apparently observing Abraham and his actions, Abimelech decides to approach him with a compromise. Their relationship obviously did not get off on the right foot, but now he sees that there’s clearly something different about Abraham. He tells him, “God is with thee in all that thou doest.” It was obvious to him, even as a non-believer. \n\nThe good news is that you can rebuild your testimony even if it does get broken. It takes time, but it can be done. It’s amazing to see this king, who was militarily and politically superior and was in charge of an entire nation, coming to this 100-year-old man seeking an agreement of cordial relations. He had no reason to do this other than seeing the reality of God in Abraham’s life.\n\nWhen lost people look at your life, do they see something different? Do they see something in your life that they don’t have? They should be able to. They may not so openly admit that it’s the power of God in your life, and they may not be as cordial about it as Abimelech was, but there should be something about us that catches their attention. It should be noticeable to them. \n\nI think part of the problem is that we as Christians don’t want to stand out, and we don’t want to draw attention with the way we live. We’re afraid of the consequences, especially with the direction the world is headed. What is going to turn things around in the lives of those around us? It’s not which officials get in office this November, and I’d be saying that even if we did have more palatable options. If real change for the good is going to occur in this nation, it’s going to come from God’s house, not the White House. Let’s not be afraid to stand up for what’s right and let others take notice of it. \n\nI hope something that was said tonight helped and encouraged you in some way. Maybe you recognized that you need to have more faith in God and His promises. Maybe the Lord pointed out something that’s coming between you and Him that you need to deal with. Maybe you’ve realized that you haven’t been taking a stand for God the way that you should be. Whatever it is, let’s determine to be like Abraham and put it into action and obedience right away.",

    "body": "# James 1: The Purpose of Problems\nI’m excited tonight to be starting a new book study.  This one probably won’t take years like some that we’ve done, and no one is going to be able to say that it isn’t very, very practical.  We are going to start going through the book of James.\n\nOf all the books in the New Testament, James might be the most gritty and the most in-your-face practical.  Some people have called it “the Proverbs of the New Testament” because of this. It’s not a doctrinal book, it’s a book about behavior and it’s a book full of very strong and very direct language.\n\nWe are going to jump right into some practical stuff tonight, but before we do I want to give a couple of quick introductory facts about the book of James.\n\n## Introductory facts about the book of James\n1. James was most likely written by Jesus half brother.  James wasn’t saved until after Jesus’ resurrection, and he isn’t to be confused with James the brother of John (who was one of the first martyrs killed by Herod in Acts 12:2).  Still he became one of the leaders of the Jerusalem church with Peter and John.\n2. James was Jude (from the book of Jude) brother.\n3. James is probably the first New Testament book that was written.\n4. James was written to the jewish believers who were scattered after the Jerusalem church faced persecution.\n5. James is one of the most outdoorsy books in the Bible.  There are 40 references to nature in this book.\n6. James also makes a lot of references to the Old Testament.\n\nAlright, so let’s jump into the book.\n\nLet’s begin by reading verses 1-6:\n\n> *”James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.”*\n\n> *”My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations: knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.  But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.”* \n\n> *”If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not: and it shall be given him.  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering, for he that wavelets is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.  A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”*\n\n\nI’m going to focus tonight on just verses 2-4.  And the title of the message is “The Purpose of Hardships.”\n\nIf you remember, this book was written very early on in church history.  In the book of Acts, when the early church was dealing with some very tough persecution.  Not only did you have guys like Saul of Tarsus running around imprisoning people.  Herod was trying to make Christianity go away.  The High Priests hated Christianity and wanted to stamp it out.  The Pharisees hated Christianity and wanted it gone.  \n\nBasically, everyone in Jerusalem was turning up the heat of Christians and the Christians were running for their lives.  It was a tough time.\n\nSo the very first thing that James writes about here is hardships.  He says *“Count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.”*\n\n“Divers” is an easy word.  Its actually the word “diverse” just spelled differently.  It means “all different kinds of.” But “temptations” here probably doesn’t mean what you think it means.  It’s not talking about “temptations to do evil” in the way a man would be tempted by a seductress or something.  It’s talking bout trials. Putting something through a proving process. \n\nHow many of you have ever test drove a car?  What I’ve done, both times I’ve bought a car here, is gone out with Brother Dick and let him drive it.  Both times he did the same thing, he went out into the country and he drove it really fast.  He stepped on the gas then stepped on the brake.  He wiggled it back and forth on the road.  \n\nWhat was he doing?  He was putting stress on the car.  He knew the car would do fine just putting around town, but he wanted to put the car under some stress to see if something was broken. That’s a trial, that’s a temptation here.  \n\nIt is putting something through adversity, through stress, through hardship to see what it is made of.   \n\nThe only way that happens is if you are pushed to your limit.  If you are put under stress.  If things get hard.\n\nSo James says “Count it all joy when you fall into all different kinds of testings and trouble.” Or *”Count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations.”*\n\nOur response to stress - to tough trials and hardships is supposed to be…*joy???*\n\nTrouble is supposed to make us…*happy?* That doesn’t make sense.\n\nHappiness is staying in bed until 11am every day getting fanned and hand fed grapes.  Happiness is never having to do anything ourselves.  Just being waited on hand and foot.  Happiness is not having problems…right??  I mean, while you are at it, just get a bed pan and a catheter and never have to leave bed.  Ok, maybe that’s going too far.\n\nActually, life without trouble would be very, very boring and would probably make you miserable.  I mean, don’t get me wrong, a break every now and then is a good thing, but we need a challenge, we need a little trouble and a little stress or we will be miserable.\n\nSo James here is telling us how we are to handle trials and trouble.  But I want you to notice one more thing in the text.  \n\nNotice the words “fall into” there.  This isn’t a talking about a little bit of trouble.  It’s not talking about dipping your toes in trouble like some people like to do at the ocean.  No this is falling in.  This is being plunged into the middle of the deep end with your clothes on.  Trouble is everywhere.  You can’t escape it.\n\nYou ever been there.  I mean, your troubles have troubles.  You feel like they are going to just tear you apart.  Family troubles.  Money troubles.  Health troubles.  Spiritual troubles.  Marriage troubles.  Work troubles.  I mean - troubles, troubles everywhere.\n\nWhat do you do?  James says you *“Count it all joy”*\n\nSo we are supposed to be happy when we are absolutely surrounded by and drowning in trials.\n\nWhy? Let me give you a few points:\n\n## 1. Trials and troubles can either make you bitter or they can make you better.\n\nWe are to “count it all joy” when we fall into divers temptations because *knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.*\n\nIn athletics, you don’t get stronger or faster without being pushed to your limits.  You have to deal with hard workouts that are taxing or you can never lift more or run further.  It’s tough!\n\nBut it isn’t arbitrary.  The way I’m going to be able to run a marathon is to go out and run thirty miles this week.  But does that mean you should go out and run thirty miles.  No!  \n\nI’m following a plan for me written by a coach who knows me and knows what I’m doing.  I know that that tough 15 mile run is going to build my endurance and I know I can do it.   But if you haven’t run in twenty years and you try to go run fifteen miles you’ll end up in the hospital.\n\nThat’s what I mean by it’s not arbitrary.  James doesn’t come out and say this, but it’s assumed here.  These trials aren’t just random hardships. They are trials - they are testings - **they are being administered from above.**  They are designed to build you and test you.  They are designed for your benefit.\n\nIn other words **behind every hardship is an all knowing God.** He knows that they only way for you to grow is to go through trials, and He knows exactly what trials you can take and exactly what you need.  \n\nWhy go out and run 15 miles?  That’s crazy?  Why be happy about it?  Because it’s what the coach layed out to get me close tot he goal.  The same goes with spiritual trials and hardships - we can count them all joy because they are what our heavenly coach has given us to make us better and complete.\n\nBut - this is a command and it can be disobeyed.  Some people don’t meet trials with joy.  Some people don’t get better, they get bitter.  They get mad at God.  \n\nThey can’t see how God could possibly be helping them in their trial and they let the root of bitterness into their life and it troubles them.\n\nCount it all joy.  Because it isn’t arbitrary - it’s a part of God’s plan and it will make you better if you let it.\n\nA second reason why we should “count it all joy” when we encounter trouble is…\n\n## 2. Trials and troubles can either strengthen your faith or they can reveal your lack of faith.\n\nNotice it says:\n\n> *”Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.”*\n\nIt’s not just a trial - it’s “the trying of your faith.”  \n\nTroubles don’t **create** faith.  They **test** faith. \n\nTrials reveal the faith that we have.  They show us what we really believe.\n\nWhen you squish an orange, orange juice comes out.  When you squish an apple, apple juice comes out.  When you are put under pressure, your faith comes out.  What you really believe comes out.  \n\nThis helps you.  It helps you know where your faith needs strengthening and it helps you know what faith you actually have so you can move onto the next challenge and trial.\n\nJust like you will never know what your car can and cannot do until you test it, you’ll never know what you really believe until those beliefs are actually put to the test.  You can train and train a soldier, but you’ll never know if they are a good soldier until the bullets start whizzing by.   It’s the heat of trial that let’s you see where your faith is.\n\nDo you know why most people grow up?  Because they have to.  They have to pay the bills.  They have to take care of a family.  They are hit with responsibility and trouble of adulthood and they step up to it.  If they never have to face responsibility, they will probably never grow up and mature.\n\nThe same is true of our faith.  We exercise our faith because we have to.  And if we never have to, we never exercise our faith and we never grow.\n\nSo \n* Trials and troubles can either make you bitter or make you better, \n* trials and troubles strengthen your faith or they can reveal your lack of faith.\n\nOne more thing:\n\n## 3. Trials and troubles can either be run away from or endured.  \n\nThe verse says *”the trying of your faith worketh patience.”*\n\nThat word “patience” is the greek word “huponamay” it’s literally two words that mean “to stay” and “under.”\n\nPatience in the Bible sense isn’t staying in the doctors waiting room when you want to leave.  That’s passive patience.  Patience is the virtue of enduring.  It’s a refusal to give up when you are dealing with something hard and stressful.   It’s staying under the load even when the load is heavy and hard.\n\nYou know there are some “loads” you need to “stay under”.  \n* Kids, school can be a “load”.  It can be tough.  But you “stay under” that load or you are going to have to deal with a much heavier load later in life.  \n* Staying sexually pure can be a load - it’s not easy - but it’s nothing like the load of an unwanted baby, or a bad marriage, or guilt.  \n* Saving money for retirement can be a load - but so is reaching retirement age and having nothing.  \n\nSome loads are worth dealing with.  Enduring somethings make us stronger and make us grow up.  \n\nSo when you are going through troubles, you have two paths:  You can “stay under” the load and grow in your endurance and strengthen your faith and you can grow up spiritually.  Or you can get out from under the road, not strengthen your faith, and remain spiritually immature. \n\nOne path leads to Christian maturity and strength, the other path leads to weakness and immaturity.\n",

    "body": "# The Religious Self-Protection Complex (Mark 3:1-6)\nTake your Bibles with me and turn to Mark 3 this morning.\n\nI’ve been preaching about the Pharisees.  Mark 2 and the beginning of Mark 3 give us a bunch of little pictures of the Pharisees.  It shows us the Pharisees next to Jesus, and when you put anything next to the Light, you see its impurities clearly.\n\nThe main point I’ve been making over an over these last several weeks is that the Pharisees are us. The Pharisees were religious conservatives like we are religious conservatives.  Not to beat a dead horse, but let’s review some facts about the Pharisees:\n\n* They started in a revival movement.\n* They were determined to live by the word of God.\n* They believed the Bible was 100% true.\n* They were opposed to worldliness and were determined to be separate from the world.\n* The name “Pharisees” means “the separated ones.”\n* They put their lives where their conviction was, even going to the death rather than worship idols during Greek rule.\n* They were the “old-time religion” crowd of their day.\n* They started Bible schools and taught the Bible.\n* They went to church, fasted, gave, dressed differently, didn’t drink, etc.\n\nYou get the idea.  They were religious conservatives, but they were religious monsters.  They are the consistent bad guys in the gospels.  They are the ones who are most opposed to Jesus.  They are the ones causing a lot of hardship for the people, but they are the religious conservatives.\n\nSo this whole series has been centered around this question:  \n\n> How can Bible-believing religious conservatives become monsters?\n\nAnd so far I’ve given you three answers—three “complexes” that we as religious conservative people have a tendency to get:\n\nThe first was what I called the Religious Superiority Complex.  It is when we begin to look down on sinners, and we project the attitude that God actually hates people.  \n\nThe second was what I call the Religious Solemnity Complex.  It is when we think that God is only happy when we aren’t happy—that God wants us to be solemn and serious all the time.  If the Religious Superiority Complex projects that God hates people, then the Religious Solemnity Complex projects that God hates life.  Of course, the Bible teaches us that our lives should be full of “joy” and “rejoicing.”\n\nThe third was what I call the Religious Standards Complex.  The Religious Standards Complex is when we boil down our religion to a list of external rules.  It is when we try to build fences around God’s fences.  The Religious Standards Complex makes God seem like a petty bureaucrat who is trying to make people’s lives miserable.  The Religious Standards Complex may be the most dangerous one because it actually replaces the Bible.  It replaces the cross.  \n\nToday, we are going to look at one more of these “complexes” which I’m calling “The Religious Self-Protection Complex.”  \n\nLet’s get started by reading our text, Mark 3:1-6:\n\n> *”1 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand. 2 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him. 3 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth. 4 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held their peace. 5 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 6 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.”*\n\n\nThis is our last story in this section about the Pharisees, and in this story, you see how far they are willing to go.  They go to the synagogue, not to worship God, but to trap Jesus.   They want to find something they can accuse Jesus of, and since they know that Jesus will likely heal people on the sabbath, that is the best chance they have.\n\nSo this man comes in, and he has a withered hand.  Maybe you’ve seen people like this.  One arm is stunted.  It’s not life-threatening, but it makes their life much, much harder.\n\nSo Jesus calls out the Pharisees and heals the man.  His hand miraculously grows back to look just like the other, and then Pharisees  do the weirdest thing. They go out and meet with the Herodians—who were their mortal enemies—to try to find some way to destroy Jesus.\n\n# The Religious Self-Protection Complex.  \n\nHere is a definition of the Religious Self-Protection Complex:\n\n> The Religious Self-Protection Complex is when our pride and self-interest takes over and causes us to fight the wrong fight, ignore the casualties, and align with the wicked.\n\nThis one flows out of the other ones.  \n\n* We look down on others and get filled with pride.\n* We invent ways to make ourselves miserable for God and take pride in that.\n* We create a bunch of extra-biblical rules for ourselves and those rules are a source of pride.\n\nAnd then, when anything threatens that pride, we go on the warpath, and never mind the victims and never mind who we have to align ourselves with in the process.\n\nAll the other things I’ve been preaching about are subtle. This one isn’t subtle at all.  This disease is obvious to everyone but the person who has it.   This is where the monsters show their ugly heads.   This is where a lot of church splits happen.   This one leaves lots and lots of victims in its wake.\n\nJames 3:13-16 says:\n\n> *”13 Who [is] a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. 14 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but [is] earthly, sensual, devilish. 16 For where envying and strife [is], there [is] confusion and every evil work.”* \n\nGod is warning us against preachers with envy and strife in their hearts.  Envy and strife are self-interest and competitive infighting.  That’s what we are talking about here.\n\nWhen the Religious Self-Protection complex takes over, it’s not about Jesus, and it’s not about God; it’s about YOU.  It’s about your success.  It’s about your faithfulness.  It’s about your reputation.  It’s about your crowd.\n\nI believe in earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints, but I have to tell you that a majority of religious fighting isn’t earnestly contending for the faith. It’s people protecting their egos.\n\nThere are people who want to have a bigger church, a stricter church, or who want to send more of their teenagers to Bible college, and it’s all about the ego.  It’s all self-interest.  It’s all pride.\n\nLook at the Pharisees in this story.  Notice three things about them that tend to be true when we let pride take over:\n\n## 1. They attacked the wrong people.\n\nThese Pharisees were determined to destroy Jesus and His disciples.  Think about that!\n\nThey claim to be God’s people.  They preach God’s word.  They go far and wide to make proselytes for God.  And God sends His only begotten Son, and they oppose Him.\n\nOne sad fact about religious conservatives is that they have a terrible track record of opposing God’s people.\n\nCan I tell you something you may not know?  You hear a lot about some of the preachers from the old times—pastors like Charles Spurgeon or missionaries like Hudson Taylor. \n\nLet me tell you something about Charles Spurgeon.  For most of Charles Spurgeon’s life, there were huge crowds of preachers who HATED him.  There were cartoons making fun of him in the newspaper.  There were sermons in pulpits all over England about how he was a compromiser or about how this part or that part of his ministry was sinful.  He wasn’t welcome in a lot of old-time-religion churches.\n\nWe talk about the great missionary Hudson Taylor and his ministry in China today, but in his day, preachers said he was a freak and that he was dangerous.  They criticized the way he dressed.  They criticized the way he supported himself.  The old-time-religion crowd hated Hudson Taylor.\n\nThe same could be said for George Whitfield, for John Wesley, and for just about every other famous man of God you’ve heard of from the past.  They all had religious people stepping up to condemn them and oppose them.\n\nThe Bible says that we are to *“earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints”* (Jude 2)  and that we should *”Mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them”* (Romans 16:17). We definitely have to deal with doctrinal error, but we also have to be careful. We have to be really careful that our opposition to people isn’t springing from our pride or our confusion.\n\nHere is the truth: A whole lot of the “Bless God, these newfangled preachers” kind of messages you hear are coming from pride and self-protection.  They aren’t anything new.  The old-time religion crowd makes heroes of God’s people, but usually not God’s people working today.  It’s almost always the ones from the past because they are too busy opposing God’s work today.\n\nSo they opposed the wrong people.  They opposed the work of Jesus.  We need to be careful that we don’t oppose the wrong people. \n\nThe second thing we see these Pharisees doing is really the main thing I want to talk about today...\n\n## 2. They ignored the hurting people.\n\nIn this assembly where Jesus was preaching was a man with a withered hand—a man with a handicap; a man who was hurting.\n\nAnd the Pharisees were excited.  They weren’t excited because they were going to see that man healed. They were excited because they could use that man to prove that Jesus didn’t follow their silly sabbath rules.\n\nTo me, the biggest thing that stands out in this story is that the Pharisees didn’t care at all about this hurting man—just like they didn’t care at all about the man who was sick of the palsy, and they didn’t care at all about the publicans and sinners who were sick with sin.  They didn’t care about hurting people. All they cared about was their position and themselves.\n\nI want to show you something because this is important.  It’s easy to miss this, but it’s important.  \n\nI want to read you some verses from the Old Testament book of Ezekiel, chapter 34 verses 2 through 6:\n\n> *”2 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe [be] to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? 3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: [but] ye feed not the flock. 4 The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up [that which was] broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. 5 And they were scattered, because [there is] no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered. 6 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek [after them].”*\n\nYou can find passages like this—about how mad God was against the shepherds of Israel—in most of the Old Testament prophetical books.  The shepherds were supposed to care for the hurting sheep. They were supposed to heal and to help.  They were supposed to teach and bless, but instead they were driving them away.\n\nOf course, it’s not talking about actual shepherds here. It’s talking about preachers and pastors.  God was angry because the preachers and the pastors weren’t showing the heart of God.   They were preaching over and over again at how mad God was at people and about how much they fell short, but they weren’t preaching a message of hope.  They weren’t pointing people to the Lamb.  They weren’t showing that God wanted them to be happy and that God wanted to bless them.\n\nThey were all about the rules.  They were all about making people miserable.  They were all about what was wrong with everyone, and they were driving people away from God.  They were making God look ugly.\n\nIn the book of Nehemiah, they have a bit of a revival, and God’s law is read. Then the people start to mourn when they start to realize how far short they come. Notice what God says to them in Nehemiah 8:9-10:\n\n> *”9 And Nehemiah, which [is] the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day [is] holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. 10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for [this] day [is] holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.”*\n\nWhen you come to church, it shouldn’t be to feel bad about yourself.  It shouldn’t be to remind you of how miserable you should be for Jesus.  It should be a place where the sick and the hurting are comfortable because they know there is healing there and there is joy there.\n\nLet me go to one more passage of scripture, and I’ll make this point.  Turn with me to Luke 4.  In Luke 4, Jesus is preaching in his hometown synagogue where He grew up.  He goes in and reads the the Bible. Notice the text He reads:\n\n> *”The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath appointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord.”*\n\nThen Jesus sat down.  Do you know what Jesus was saying?  He was saying, “You religious people! You old-timey shepherds!  You don’t care about people.  You aren’t after hurting people, but I’ve come to preach help to them. I’ve come to heal them. I’ve come to go after the hurting—not to chastise them, but to help them!”\n\nListen people: Religion doesn’t care about people, but Jesus does.  Religion sees sinners to be destroyed, but Jesus sees sinners to heal.  Religion sees problems to blame, but Jesus sees problems to help.\n\nPeople ought to be able to come to church and know they will find help!  People ought to know that when they come into the church house on Sunday, they will hear the Bible; they will see hope there; they will see Jesus there.\n\nYou don’t come to church so I can tear you up and tell you all the ways you come short and don’t measure up.  That’s not what it’s about.  It’s not about me preaching hot and heavy and really letting people have it.  It’s about pointing people to the Great Physician.\n\nListen, folks: Sin might have messed your life up.  Sin might be causing you all kinds of pain and you might be struggling.  Jesus wants to heal you.  Jesus wants to help you.  He didn’t come to condemn you. He came to save you.\n\nGod has given us the ministry of reconciliation.  People are on the outs with God, and He wants to reconcile.  He wants to bring them back.  He wants the prodigals to come home.  \n\nHeaven help us if the message people here is, “You aren’t good enough,” and “God hates you.”\n\nHeaven help us if that message of the gospel doesn’t come out loud and clear.  \n\nGod loves hurting people, and Jesus heals hurting people, but \nreligion ignores hurting people.\n\nSo they opposed the wrong people; they ignored the hurting people.  One more thing their self-protection caused them to do was...\n\n## 3. They aligned with wicked people.\n\nVerse 6 in our text says:\n\n> *”And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.”*\n\nNow let me tell you what’s going on there.  The Pharisees were the ultra-conservative religious crowd.  The Herodians were the ultra-liberal irreligious crowd.  These two groups were mortal enemies.  This is like Ted Cruz collaborating with Bernie Sanders.  This is like PETA launching a joint initiative with the NRA.  \n\nThese people hate each other, but they hate Jesus more, so they finally found something that brought them together: Their pride, their self-interest, their mutual opposition to something good.\n\nThis is when this self-protection complex really rears it’s ugly head. It’s when you see what people are willing to excuse to protect their position.  People will hold their nose and look away so that their position and their pride don’t take a hit.\n\nReligion does that.  Religion does that when some famous preacher is obviously into sin, and everyone is pretending like they don’t see it.  “Nothing to see here, so just move along.”  It’s happened so many times.  It’s self-interest and self-protection.  We have to protect the group, the name, the cause.\n\nIt’s ugly.  That’s the only word for it: Ugly.\n\nListen to me, and I’m going to wrap this up.  All over this country and all around the world, there are victims of conservative religion.  \n\n* There are people who got the impression that God hates them because of a bunch of religious people put them down.  \n* There are people who got the impression that God wants them to be miserable because a bunch of conservative religious people didn’t show the joy of the Lord. \n* There are people who got the impression that God wants to micromanage every aspect of their life because a bunch of religious people multiplied and emphasized rules and standards. \n* And there are a bunch of people who got the impression that God doesn’t care about them because a bunch of religious people used them and then disposed of them when they didn’t help their self-interest.\n\nIs it any wonder people aren’t interested in church?  Is it any wonder that 85% of our young people stop going to church when they hit college and never look back?  Is it any wonder we have generations of preachers running for the hills into anything and everything but the “old-time religion”?\n\nReligion can get ugly.  Religion leaves a pile of victims in its wake.  Religion hurts people.\n\nBut then there is Jesus.  Look at Jesus in this passage.  The religious people are looking down on sinners, and Jesus is loving them.  The religious people are trying to make life solemn and ugly, and Jesus is enjoying it with His disciples.  The religious people are making rules and rules and rules, and Jesus doesn’t care a lick about them.  The religious people are all about self-interest, and Jesus is all about others.\n\nWhat kind of Christians are we going to be?  Are we going to be the old-time religion crowd?  Are we going to turn into religious monsters like these Pharisees, or are we going to be like Jesus?  Are we going to love people, have joy, keep the rules in perspective, and refuse to use people?\n\nHow about you?  Let’s stand for invitation and pray.",

    "body": "# The Religious Superiority Complex\nEvery great story has a great bad guy.\n\nStories without bad guys are kind of boring.  Snow White needs the wicked witch.  Sleeping Beauty needs Maleficent.  Beauty and the Beast needs a Gaston.  Batman needs the Joker.  The Boston Red Sox need the New York Yankees.  You get the idea.\n\nThe gospels, the stories of the life and death of Jesus, have a consistent bad guy.  The problem is that the bad guy in the gospels isn’t who you would think.  It isn’t the scary Roman soldiers with their powerful oppression.  It isn’t the wicked Herodians with their do-whatever-you-want attitude.  It isn’t the corrupt Sadducees who were incredibly liberal and politicized.  It isn’t the tax collectors, the prostitutes, or some hated minority.  **The bad guy in the gospel records is us**.\n\nBy “us,” I mean conservative religious people; the people who were serious about obeying God; the people who loved the Bible; the people who held to the old traditions.  These people in the gospels are represented by the Pharisees.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated and obsessed with the Pharisees.  Since I was in college, I’ve read everything I could about them.  What I’ve found out might surprise you.\n\nYou see, the Pharisees were not monsters.  At least they didn’t start out that way.  When you read the Old Testament, the Jews kept chasing idolatry.  The Old Testament sometimes seems like just the chronicle of the failing Jews.  They failed over and over again to resist temptation and love God.  They chased idol after idol.   Finally, God had had enough and sent them into captivity.\n\nWhen they got back from captivity, there was a group of Jews who had a revival, and they said, “Enough is enough. We need to separate from all of this wicked nonsense, serve God, and become the people who truly live by the Bible.”  These people called themselves “the separated ones” or “the Pharisees.”\n\nAnd they were serious about it.  They really did love the Bible.  They really did want to please God.  At one point between the Old and New Testaments, they chose certain death by the hands of the Greeks over compromising their faith.  They passed on their religious way of life from generation to generation and by the time Jesus came on the scene, they were a powerful force in Israel.  They were the people who loved the Bible, and they were the people who were trying to live it out in their daily lives.  They were the conservative religious people.  \n\nThe Pharisees are us.  Once you realize that, the gospels take on a whole new meaning and have a whole different application in our lives. \n\nAnd paradoxically, they—the religious people, the moral people, the conservatives, the old time religion crowd—are the biggest bad guys in the story of Jesus.\n\nLet’s read as our text this morning Mark 2:15-17:\n\n> *”15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? 17 When Jesus heard [it], he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”*\n\nMark 2 and the beginning of Mark 3 gives us a series of stories with one common theme: The bad guys - The Pharisees. \n\n*  When Jesus heals the man sick of the palsy, they are sitting there (it’s standing room only, and they are sitting) judging Jesus and trying to catch Him in His words.\n* In verses 3-17, when Jesus calls Levi the tax collector and makes him one of His disciples, the Pharisees are there to criticize.\n* In verse 18, the Pharisees are giving Jesus and His disciples a hard time about not fasting like they thought they were supposed to.\n* In verses 23-27, the bad guys show up again to pick on the disciples for supposedly breaking the sabbath by eating a snack when they walked through a field. \n* And in the first part of chapter 3, they are in a synagogue on the sabbath, trying to judge Jesus because He dared to heal someone on the sabbath day.\n\nI think we can look at the Pharisees in this chapter and see four things, four traps, four sicknesses, that we as conservative religious people have to be especially careful not to fall into.  These are four ways that conservative religious people like us can turn into monsters.  There is a popular business book titled *The Five Dysfunctions of a Team*. Over the next four weeks, I’m going to preach a little series from this chapter called: **The Four Dysfunctions of Religious Conservatives.”** \n\nFor the next four weeks, we are going to look into these stories, and we are going to see four traps that we as conservative religious people are prone to fall into.  These are four ways that we as Bible believers can turn into the bad guys; fours ways we can become monsters.  \n\nCan I be honest with you?  My favorite people are Christians.  Church people are my people.  I can tell you where every one of my best friends will be this morning, but church people have also been some of the biggest monsters in my life.  True religion is life-saving and life-giving medicine, but even life-saving medicine can be abused.  Well-meaning religious people can be ugly.  We are going to see that over the next four weeks.\n\nAnd we are going to see something else as we look at these four things: We are going to see Jesus.  When you put Jesus next to the religious monsters, He becomes so much more attractive and so much more powerful.  And the truth is that the only remedy for these dysfunctions is a long look at Jesus.\n\nSo let’s pray and I’ll preach on the first of these dysfunctions, something I’m calling “The religious superiority complex.”\n\n**Let’s pray**\n\nThe first dysfunction of religious conservatives that we see comes out in verses 13-17 where Jesus called a man named Levi to be his disciple.  Levi was a publican (a tax collector).\n\nLevi, of course, would go on to become Matthew.  This tax collector would end up writing one of the four gospels.  He would be faithful to the end and would preach the gospel to many people.  History tells us he became a missionary and traveled around the world preaching the gospel.  Like all of the other disciples, he would probably end up dying for Jesus as a martyr.\n\nBut at this point he was a publican.  He was a tax man.\n\nNobody likes a tax man, even today.  The Topps trading card company is never going to make a set of IRS auditor cards. \n\nBut the tax men of Jesus day were much more hated than the tax men of today.  The tax collectors in Jesus’ day were kind of franchisees of the Roman Government.  Not only did they take what the Roman government demanded, but they could find ways to add extra fees and tolls to enrich themselves.\n\nNobody was more hated by the conservative Jews than the publicans.  It was the most despised job in Israel.  Being a publican in Israel was something like being an abortion doctor today.  It was a job that made you very rich and also a job that immediately meant that you were hated by most people.\n\nSo Jesus comes and says to this publican, “Follow me,” and the publican just gets up, leaves his life behind, and follows Jesus.  Then he invites all his publican friends to eat with Jesus so He can change them as well.\n\nAnd the Pharisees—the religious crowd—look on, and they can’t stand it.  They say in verse 15: *“How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?”*\n\nIn other words: “How dare he, a religious teacher, eat with a bunch of sell-outs, worldlings, and prostitutes!”\n\nThat was their attitude.\n\nYou see, the Pharisees hated the publicans and other groups so much that they couldn’t imagine anyone spending time with them for any reason whatsoever.  Even though it was evident that Levi was giving up being a publican and following Jesus, they couldn’t stand it.\n\nThis is the religious superiority complex.  Let me give you a couple of points about this:\n\n## 1. The definition of the religious superiority complex\n\nThe religious superiority complex is this: \n\n> It is when religious people begin to look down and hate the very ones they should be reaching out to and lifting up.\n\nWhen you fall victim to the religious superiority complex, you move from the idea that God hates sin to the idea that God hates people.  You start to see people as an enemy to be destroyed rather than as a mission field to be reached.\n\nJesus said in John 3:17:\n\n> *”For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”*\n\nBut when you get the religious superiority complex, you start to condemn everyone.  You start to think that this is the heart of God. You believe you are the good ones, and they are the bad ones.  You are the ones who follow the rules, who read the Bible, who go to church, who pay the tithes, and those people—all those people you see at Wal-mart or you watch on TV—are just kindling for God’s wrath.\n\nYou start to see people as the enemy: Those Democrats; those Mexicans; those people at the church down the road.  \n\nYou start to compare yourself with them and pat yourself on the back.\n\nAnd before long, you start to believe two things:\n\nOne: That you are kind of all right.  You are a pretty good person.  I mean, Christ might have saved you, but He didn’t have to save you from much.\n\nThe second thing you begin to believe is that God hates them, and they are beyond God’s mercy.  You would be okay if God judged them all.\n\nAnd this leads me to...\n\n## 2. The Root Problems with the Religious Superiority Complex.\n\nThere are two root issues with the religious superiority complex.\n\nThe first of these is that when we get like this...\n\n### A. We underestimate God’s mercy and grace.\n\nListen to me.  God is far, far more merciful than we give Him credit for.  God wants to save sinners more than we ever could want Him to save sinners.  We are so prone to forget that.\n\nThis morning in Sunday School, we talked about the parable of the lost sheep.  That’s an amazing parallel to this story.  It really shows the heart of God. He wants to go after the lost sheep and then rejoice when he is found again.\n\nThis week in my devotions, I read the book of Jonah.  Jonah was called by God to go to the biggest city in the world at the time, Nineveh, and preach the grace and mercy of God to them.  He didn’t want to do it.  He hated the Assyrians.  He tried to run from God’s call.\n\nYou know the story.  He ended up in the belly of a fish.  He repents and gets spat out.  He reluctantly goes into the middle of this great city and preaches a super short message, and the Ninevites repent.  They turn to God.\n\nAnd Jonah was mad about it.  He went out to the desert overlooking the city to stew and whine about it.  A plant he was using for shade shrivels up and dies, and Jonah is mad at God about it.  It’s a really weird way to end the story.\n\nBut there is one amazing verse at the end of Jonah I want to read to you because it shows the heart and mercy of God.  Jonah 4:11 says:\n\n> *”And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and [also] much cattle?”*  \n\nGod was saying, “There are 120,000 children in this city, and you want me to destroy it?  There are innocent animals in this city, and you want me to wipe it out?”\n\nThat’s what the religious superiority complex does to us.  It makes us hate people.  It makes us think that God hates people, too.  It makes us forget that God is merciful to the core.\n\nIn the story of Jonah, God showed mercy to the heathen sailors.  God showed mercy to the Ninevites.  But do you know who got the most mercy in that story?  It was Jonah.\n\nAnd that brings me to the second root problem with the religious superiority complex...\n\n### B. We forget that we are the recipients of God’s mercy and grace.\n\nI don’t know about you, but there are things in my past I’m not at all proud of.  There are things I’ve said, thoughts I’ve thought, things I’ve watched that would thoroughly humiliate me if you were to know them.  When God saved me, He saved a proud, arrogant, lustful, rebellious, angry little punk.  It was an act of mercy.  It was an act of grace.\n\nAnd do you know what? I need that mercy every day.  I’m so grateful for Lamentations 3:22-23, which says:\n\n> *”22 [It is of] the LORD'S mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. 23 [They are] new every morning: great [is] thy faithfulness.”*\n\nI wasn’t just dependent on the mercies of God to get saved.  I’m dependent on the mercies of God to stay saved.  I’m dependent on those mercies every day.\n\nAnd you are, too.  If you are saved today, God didn’t save a righteous man or woman; He saved a sinner.  And let’s be honest: You rely on that same mercy every day.\n\nBut if we are not careful, we’ll forget that.  We’ll start to think we are something.  We’ll start to think we aren’t that bad.  Then we’ll look around at the world and think they are a mess deserving of God’s wrath, and it gets ugly, folks.\n\nWe start to project to the world that God hates people and wants to destroy them.\n\nIt’s a particular trap for conservative religious people.  It’s a trap for us.  \n\nNow, I’ve given you a diagnosis.  We’ve identified the sickness.  Let’s look at the medicine.\n\nWe’ve defined the religious superiority complex.  We’ve talked about the two root issues of the superiority complex.  But in this passage we have... \n\n## 3. The cure to the religious superiority complex.\n\nAnd listen, folks: The cure isn’t an idea.   It isn’t a maxim.  The cure is a person.  The cure is Jesus Christ.\n\nThe religious superiority complex says, “God hates people, especially those people.”  \n\nBut look at Jesus here.  Look at Him!  Jesus cares about these people.  Jesus loves these people.  Jesus can save these people, transform these people, and use these people.\n\nHow can this be?  How can God be good and still show mercy to people who are bad?  God is the Judge, and a good judge punishes.  If we had a judge that just forgave everybody, we’d throw him out.\n\nThis is a real problem.  The Bible puts it this way: How can God be just and be a justifier of the wicked?\n\nHow can Jesus be holy and show such mercy to unholy people?  How can Jesus be just and show grace and love to wicked people?\n\nI mean, shouldn’t the crooked tax collectors of this world pay?  Shouldn’t the thieves pay?  Shouldn’t the murderers get theirs?\n\nYou know the answer.  God can show love and mercy to the sinners because God already punished their sin.\n\nAt the end of this book of Mark, Jesus would be put on a cross to die, and the sins of those wicked people would be put on His shoulders.  \n\nJohn 3:16-17 are two of the most famous verses in the Bible, and they are very appropriate here:\n\n> *”16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”*\n\nGod loves sinners.  Jesus died for sinners.  \n\nIf you are a sinner this morning, come to Jesus.  Put your faith and trust in Him.  He didn’t come to condemn you; He came to save you.  He came to heal you.  He’ll show you His mercy and grace.  Why not do what Levi did in this story and get up and follow Him?  Trust Him.  Believe on Him.\n\nMost of us this morning give testimony that we’ve already done that. Do you know what we need this morning?  We need to remember that same message: God loves sinners.  God shows us mercy and grace. \n\nThe Apostle Paul said in 1 Timothy 1:15:\n\n> *”This [is] a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.”*\n\nIf you have been the victim of the religious superiority complex today, repent of that.  Look to Jesus and let it fall away.\n\nFor our invitation song this morning, I want us to sing “Amazing Grace,” and I want you to think about the words.  *”Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.”*",

    "body": "Take your Bibles and turn today to John 11.  John 11.\n\nFor the last month, I’ve been preaching a little series called “The I Ams of Jesus” - there are seven statements Jesus made about who He is in John and each one of them is significant.  Each one of them teaches us about what it is all about - Jesus.\n\nChristianity is about Jesus.  He is the alpha and the omega.  He is the beginning and the end.  He is the one by whom all things consist.  Of Him and to Him and through Him are all things.  It’s all about Jesus.\n\nHeaven is going to be a celebration of Jesus.  There are going to be people from every tribe and every tongue circled around the throne room of God singing Glory to Jesus.  It’s all about Him.\n\nSo it’s helpful for us sometimes to look at Jesus and listen to the words of Jesus and learn about Jesus, because everything else in the Christian life revolves around Jesus.\n\nJohn 11 is a great chapter.  It’s actually the beginning of the end of Jesus earthly ministry.  It records Jesus last trip from Galilee in northern Israel to Judea in Southern Israel where Jesus would be betrayed and crucified.  \n\nIf you were to look at this passage on a timeline of Jesus life, it would come right before the triumphal entry (or Palm Sunday) and then the Passover and last supper.  In fact, at the end of John 11, you see the Pharisees and the High Priests conspiring about trapping Jesus.  \n\nBut this isn’t just a great chapter because of what is around it, it is a great chapter because what is in it.  In this chapter Jesus does one of His greatest miracles, He raises a man from the dead who had been dead for four days.  And in the context of that He says in verse 25:\n\n> *”Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:”*\n\nIt’s a great story and a great verse.  \n\nBecause it’s great, we are going to take the time to read all of it.  I’m going to read a very lengthy passage of scripture this morning - 46 verses - because I want you to understand the whole story.\n\nSo let’s read John 11:1-46\n\n> *”1 Now a certain [man] was sick, [named] Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. 2 (It was [that] Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) 3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 4 When Jesus heard [that], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. 5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. 6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. 7 Then after that saith he to [his] disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. 8 [His] disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. 10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. 11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. 16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had [lain] in the grave four days already. 18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off: 19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. 20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat [still] in the house. 21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it] thee. 23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? 27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. 28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 29 As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly, and came unto him. 30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. 35 Jesus wept. 36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? 38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been [dead] four days. 40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 41 Then they took away the stone [from the place] where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up [his] eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me. 43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done”*\n\nThere are four lessons from this story about Jesus that I want to teach you today.  They are four areas of life that Jesus teaches us about in this passage.  They are relationships, risk, regret and resurrection.  Let’s pray and we’ll cover two of those four things this morning (we’ll cover the other two tonight).\n\n**Pray**\n\nThe first lesson from this story is…\n\n# 1. Jesus and relationships\nYou see, one of the beautiful things about this passage is that it highlights the special relationship that Jesus had with individual people.\n\nA family: Mary, who wiped Jesus feet with her hair.  Martha, who was busy serving Jesus and Lazarus, their brother.  These three had a very special relationship with Jesus, and what I love about this chapter is that it points that out.\n\nLook at verse 3:\n\n> *”Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.”*\n\nLook at verse 5:\n\n> *”Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.”*\n\n\nAnd look near the end, at verse 36 (everyone’s favorite memory verse): \n\n> *”Jesus wept.”*\n\nAnd look at the next verse:\n\n> *”Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!”*\n\nThere are two things that we learn about Jesus here that have to do with relationships:\n\n## First, Jesus cares deeply for individuals.\n\nWe sing “Jesus loves me this I know” but do you know what, if you are one of His, He does love you.  He loves you and cares for you very much.  Over and over in this passage it mentions how much Jesus loved the individuals in this little family.\n\nHe loved Martha - workaholic Martha.\nHe loved Mary - emotional and volatile Mary.\nAnd He loved Lazarus.\n\nHe loved them so much, He couldn’t see them hurting without weeping himself.\n\nHe saw the pain and the anguish in their soul and it hurt Him.\n\nI remember when I was very young watching Bill Clinton on the debate stage when he was running for president stand look directly at a lady and say “I feel your pain.”  \n\nJesus feels our pain.  Jesus cares for you.   You may be going through something that is terrible, just terrible and you may think “No one knows what I’m going through, no one understands and no one cares.” But Jesus cares.\n\nSing it with me…\n\n“Oh yes He cares, I know He cares, His heart is touched with my grief though the days are weary the long night dreary I know my Savior cares.”  \n\n---\n\nBut do you know what, if you were paying attention when we first read this story, it didn’t *seem* like Jesus cared.  Jesus heard about Lazarus being sick and then purposely waited until he had been dead for four days before He went to visit.\n\nThey didn’t have the internet, they didn’t have email or phones, there was no FaceTime.  The disciples had no idea what kind of condition that Lazarus was in: But Jesus knew.  Jesus knew full well that he had died and he knew full well that Mary and Martha were mourning their brother for four full days.\n\nAnd yet He waited.\n\nThat seems kind of callous doesn’t it?  I mean, I kind of feel for poor Mary and Martha.  I understand why both Mary and Martha said *“Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.”*\n\nIt kind of seems almost mean of Jesus to be able to stop Lazarus from dying, to know that Mary and Martha were grieving, and to still wait.\n\nBut Jesus knew what He was doing.\n\nThe second thing we learn from this passage about our relationship with Jesus is:\n\n## Jesus responds to us with an eternal vision.\n\nWay up in verse 4, Jesus said \n\n> *”This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.”*\n\nJesus knew what He was doing.  A whole lot of people were going to believe on Jesus because of what happened to Lazarus.  If Jesus had come sooner, they may have said “Oh, he didn’t really die.”  But Lazarus was decomposing.  Jesus waited until he stank.\n\nSometimes it doesn’t seem like Jesus cares.  Sometimes it doesn’t seem like Jesus even hears the cry of our heart.  Sometimes He says “no.”  Often He says “wait.”\n\nBut do you know what…God knows what He is doing, and if He is allowing you to go through a tough time it is for your good and His glory.  Because He sees the end from the beginning.\n\nSo we learn about Jesus relationships.\n\nThe second thing we learn about our life from Jesus here is about…\n\n# 2. Jesus and risk\nLook at verse 7 with me:\n\n> *”Then after that He saith unto his disciples, let us go into Judea again”*\n\nSo, Jesus has waited long enough.  It’s time to go see Mary and Martha and put them out of their misery.  It’s time to go down to Judea and raise Lazarus.\n\nBut look at what the disciples say:\n\n> *”His disciples say unto him, Master, the jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again.”*\n\nIn other words, what his disciples were saying was that Judea was *dangerous.*   Judea was filled with powerful people who wanted to kill Jesus and the disciples knew that if Jesus went to Judea, He probably wouldn’t leave.  He would probably be killed there.\n\nNow, let me ask you something, were the disciples right?  Yes.  They were right.  This was Jesus last trip.  He was going to get betrayed in Judea and He was going to be crucified.  They were right.\n\nBut I want you to notice how Jesus answered them in verse 9:\n\n> *”Jesus answered, are there not twelve hours in a day?  If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.  But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.”*\n\nNow, don’t skip over this.  It’s important.  That might not seem like it makes any sense, but Jesus was making an important point here.\n\nJesus was making two points about how we deal with risk and danger here:\n\nThe first point is:\n\n## We have each been given an allotted task and an allotted time to do it.\n\nThat’s what the analogy of “walking in the day” is referring to.  It’s referring to living in God’s will.  Doing the things that God wants us to do.  Jesus was saying “I’ve got twelve hours of sunshine to do my Father’s work, let’s make hay while the sun shines.”\n\nHere are what a couple of commentators said about these verses:\n\n> “Jesus is saying that a man must finish the day’s work within the day, for the night comes when work is ended.” (Barclay)\n\n> “There are but twelve hours in the day, and it will be sunset before you dream of it. Get done what God has sent you here to do.” (Morrison)\n\nLet me tell you something, each of you have a God-given job to do.  Each of you have some kind of ministry, some kind of bigger purpose, God has something He wants you to do.  Every one of you.  \n\nSomeday you will stand before God and you will hear either “well done my good and faithful servant” or something else.  But God has given you a task to preform with this life and He expects you to do the task.\n\nLet me tell you something else: your time is limited.  There are only so many hours in a day, only so many days in a week, only so many weeks in a year and only so many years in a life.  You will not live forever here in this life.  You will in eternity, but not here.  Your time is limited.\n\nSo each of us need to make full use of the time that God has given us to do the task that God has given us.  We need to be “redeeming the time” because the days are evil.  We have limited time to do God’s will.\n\nBut the second thing I think that Jesus was trying to teach His disciples and us here is this:\n\n## When we are doing God’s will in God’s way and in God’s time, we really are invincible.\n\nIn other words, if we just focus on doing God’s will in the time He has given us, then nothing can shorten our time.  You are going to get the amount of hours that God has given you.\n\nNow, of course, I’m not saying you should be stupid.  I’m not saying you should say “nothing can shorten my time, so I’m going to smoke three packs a day and eat a dozen donuts for breakfast every morning.”  I’m not saying you say “nothing can shorten my time, so I’m going to go parachuting without a parachute.”  \n\nBut what I am saying is that if you are just following God, your safety, protection and welfare is up to Him.  \n\nDo you know what the most repeated command in the Bible is?  It is *“fear not.”*. That command is found 144 times in the scripture.  *Fear not.* \n\nPhilippians 4:6 says:\n\n> *”Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.”*\n\nJust put it in God’s hands.  Just turn your fears and your cares over to Him and focus on doing the work He’s given you to do in the time He’s given you to do it.  Let Him take care of the other circumstances.\n\nYou’ve only got 12 hours of daylight, so you better walk while the sun is shining.  \n\n---\n\nNow listen, I haven’t even got to our text verse yet.  I’m going to cover the last two points tonight.  Let me ask you two questions in closing this morning:\n\n1. Do you have a relationship with Jesus?  Are you one of His?\n2. Are you making full use of the sunshine?  Are you doing God’s will with your life?",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me again and turn to John 11.  This morning I started a message on this chapter, and I never actually got to the main verse.  So we are going to read it again, we are going to read verses 20 to verse 46.\n\n> *”20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary sat [still] in the house. 21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give [it] thee. 23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? 27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. 28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 29 As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly, and came unto him. 30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see. 35 Jesus wept. 36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? 38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been [dead] four days. 40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 41 Then they took away the stone [from the place] where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up [his] eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me. 42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me. 43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. 44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. 45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on him. 46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.”*\n\nThis morning, I gave you the first two points about Jesus and life, just for the sake of the people who weren’t here, the first point was:\n\n# 1. Jesus and relationships\nAnd we talked about how Jesus cares deeply for us as individual people.  Over and over again in this passage it mentions how Jesus loved Lazarus or Mary or Martha.  He cared for them.  They had a personal relationship with Him and He even wept when they wept.\n\nSo we talked about how Jesus is compassionate, how he feels our pain, how He weeps with us when we weep and rejoices with us when we rejoice.\n\nBut we also talked about how this story is evidence that Jesus doesn’t handle our request with human eyes, but with eternal eyes.  He sees the end from the beginning, and sometimes our prayers seem to be bouncing off the ceiling, sometimes it seems like Jesus doesn’t care, when in actuality he is trying to do something great for our good and his glory through our suffering.\n\nThen my second point this morning was about \n\n# 2. Jesus and risk\nAnd we looked at verses 8-9 where Jesus dealt with the objections of the disciples.  They rightly believed that if Jesus went to Judea again (Mary, Martha and Lazarus lived right outside Jerusalem) that they would be taken by the Pharisees and Priests and killed.  That is exactly what happened.  But in answering them, Jesus talked about how there are twelve hours of daylight.\n\nBasically, Jesus was saying you make hay when the sun shines.  And I think He was teaching us that we all have an allotted time and an allotted task and we need to make full use of our time to accomplish that task.\n\nI also think that Jesus was teaching us that when we are doing God’s will in God’s time and God’s way - nothing is going to touch us.  Nothing is going to take any of our allotted sunshine away before it is God’s time.  It’s the truth that “if God be for us, who can be against us?”\n\nThat’s where I left off this morning.  So let’s get to the second two points.\n\nThe third point is… \n\n# 3. Jesus and regret\nOne of the things I see a lot of in this story is disappointment.  Mary and Martha and even to a lesser extent the disciples had to swallow big portions of disappointment. \n\nTwo different people (Mary and Martha) say the exact same thing to Jesus in verses 21 and 32 they said:\n\n> *”Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.”*\n\nThat sounds like disappointment to me.  It sounds like the cry of a hurting soul whose dreams were crushed.\n\nWomen didn’t take care of themselves in Jesus day.  While some worked, almost all women were dependent on a male family member.  We don’t know the details, but I imagine that Martha and Mary had a bleak future ahead of them without their brother to take care of them.  Like so many people who lose loved ones, they had to start figuring out how to move on with their life and they were scared to death to do it.\n\nI think there are a couple of lessons for us from this point:\n\n## First, sometimes in life things don’t work out the way that we want them to.\n\nOk.  I say “sometimes” but I mean “almost always.” Every one of us is going to have to deal with some measure of disappointment in life.  Every one of us is going to fail, is going to be hurt by people we trusted, is going to lose loved ones too soon, is going to have to deal with outside circumstances that devastate our dreams.\n\nI could literally take you through every single major character in the Bible right now and talk about their disappointments: \n\n* Adam and Even getting kicked out of the garden, then seeing their oldest son kill their second oldest son.\n* Noah preaching for 100 years and having zero converts.\n* Abraham going decades without a son and then having to push out Ishmael.\n* Isaac watching the conflict between his two sons.\n* Jacob having to work 14 years for a crooked father in law and seeing his family tore apart by sin.\n* Joseph being sold into slavery, then put into prison.\n\nWe aren’t even out of Genesis yet.  Do I have to go on?\n\nIf you were to take out a napkin and write out your dreams on the back of it, I almost guarantee that either 1) things won’t turn out the way you want or 2) if they do, they will involve far more heartache and setbacks than you imagined.\n\nI imagine that every one of you older folks can look back at your life and see things you never asked for or wanted to happen:\n* Sour economies that forced you off the family farm.\n* Loved ones who died way too soon.\n* Sicknesses you have had to deal with.\n* Children who didn’t follow God the way you hoped they would.\n* Disappointment in your career.\n* Disappointment in your marriage.\n\nSo many things disappoint us.  \n\nSo the question is, how do we treat Jesus when we have regrets in life?  Do we blame Him?  Do we refuse to follow Him? \n\nOne thing I think we can learn from this story, particularly from the example of Martha, is… \n\n## Second, we need to trust God even when the answer is “no.”\nEven when Martha was grieving, even when she thought she would only see her brother again in Heaven, she still made one of the clearest confessions of faith to Jesus we see in the whole Bible.  Look at what she says in verse 27:\n\n> *”She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.”*\n\nAnd then she left.  She trusted Jesus to do what is right.  I think that is amazing faith.  Amazing faith.\n\nIt’s easy to follow Jesus when everything is going our way, it’s a lot tougher when we are hit with disappointment and regret to say “I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back.”\n\nWhen you are going through a time of disappointment, what is going to get you through is a thorough knowledge of who God is, a thorough knowledge of God’s character.  It is an unwavering faith that, despite your circumstances, God is still good and God still cares.\n\nGod is good in the palace and God is good in the prison.  God is good when things are going our way and when things really stink for us.  God is good when we are rejoicing and He is good when we are hurting.\n\nAnd our faith has to be tried and our relationship to Him has to be strong so we can keep saying that even when it is really, really difficult.\n\nSo the third point is about disappointment, or to keep them all “R”s regret.\n\nLet me give you one last point:\n\n# 4. Jesus and resurrection\nThe actual “I am” statement in this chapter is found in verse 25.  Let’s look at it one more time:\n\n> *”Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:”*\n\nThere is a lot to chew on just in this verse.  Jesus is promising us two things in this verse:\n\n## First, Jesus is promising us that we can have spiritual life now.\n\nJesus said *”he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:”*\n\nThe truth is that outside of Jesus, before we are saved, we are spiritually dead.\n\n1 John 5:12 says:\n\n> *”He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”*\n\nEphesians 2:1 says:\n\n> *”And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;”*\n\nOutside of Jesus, we are dead.  When you go into the world you are looking at a bunch of spiritual corpses.  They don’t have the life-giving Spirit of God in them.  They don’t have salvation.  They are spiritually dead.\n\nBut when a person trusts Christ, they get life.  They become spiritually alive.  That’s what “quickened” means in that verse we just read, it means “To make alive”\n\nWhen you trust Christ as your Savior you are *“born again”* and as a part of that you are *“born of the Spirit”*: You have spiritual life.\n\nIn John 5:24-25 Jesus put it pretty plainly: \n\n> *”Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.”*\n\nIf you don’t have spiritual life, if you never pray, if you never talk to God, if none of this Bible stuff really makes sense to you and you don’t really want any of it, perhaps you are still spiritually dead.  Perhaps you need to believe.  \n\n---\n\nOne more thing Jesus was promising here and we’ll close:\n\nBack in our text, in verse 26 Jesus said:\n\n> *”And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?”* \n\nOf course, Jesus wasn’t talking about never dying on this earth, He was promising the second thing:\n\n## Second, Jesus is promising us that we can have eternal life later.\n\nWhen we go to heaven we will have eternal life.  Do you know why they call it eternal life?  Because it never ends.  We get to be with Jesus forevermore.  We get to serve Jesus forevermore.  We will never die again, we will never know the shame of sin again, we will walk on streets of gold and join the blood washed throng praising Jesus.\n\nIt’s eternal life.\n\n---\n\nSo to wrap this up, what is the one thing that pulls all of this together? Our relationship with Jesus, the risks we have to go through with Jesus, the regrets we have to live through with Jesus and the resurrection we can have with Jesus?  It’s really simple - it’s believing.  \n\nSimply believe.\n\n* If you believe in Jesus you are one of his beloved.\n* If you believe in Jesus He will protect you as you do His will.\n* If you believe in Jesus He will bear you through the trials of life.\n* If you believe in Jesus He will give you life here and eternal life later.\n\nJust believe.  Super, super simple. ",

    "body": "Today's message touches on a subject that I've given a ton of thought to.  If I'm known for anything by pastors outside of our church - it's my writing on this subject.  Depending on who you are - this may make you mad, it may make you rejoice.  I think it steps on everyone's toes.  Today we are going to look at a passage that really speaks to rules - Christian rules - standards if you will - and the reason behind those rules.  \n\nNow, this is a \"thinking cap\" kind of message.  You are going to have to hang on and follow along.  I'll do my best to make it interesting - but it's definitely important.  So try to stay with me.\n\nBefore we get into the passage - let's review the context for a minute.  If you remember from last Sunday, there is a group of people that are going around the world telling gentile Christians that they have to follow the jewish law - they have to eat kosher, they have to observe the sabbath, they have to go through circumcision, etc.  They are saying that you have to do those things if you want to be saved.\n\nThat's heresy.  That's a problem.  But remember - at this time, the vast majority of Christians were from a jewish background.  They were doing this stuff already.  So it was an easy heresy for most of them to swallow.\n\nPaul and Barnabas had a real problem with it and they took their problem to the highest court there was - the church at Jerusalem.  The apostles had a long discussion on it and in the end, their decision was summarized by James in verses 19-21:\n\n> *\"Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.\"*\n\nThat's where we left off last week.  Today, we are going to continue right there and read verses 22 to 35.\n\n> *\"22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: 23 And they wrote [letters] by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren [send] greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia: 24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, [Ye must] be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no [such] commandment: 25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell [you] the same things by mouth. 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. 30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 31 [Which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed [them]. 33 And after they had tarried [there] a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. 34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. 35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.\"*\n\nOur outline this morning is going to be simple.  Basically, two points and some lessons as we look at this passage.  \n\nThe first point is:\n\n## 1. The Test\n\n**The star of this chapter is the commands that James and the apostles give to the gentile churches.**  We see them in verse 20.  Then the rest of these verses tell us how they were carried to the gentile churches.  Then you see them again in verses 29-30.\n\nSo this passage is all about this command we see in verse 20 and in verse 29.  How it was received.  How it was transmitted.  \n\nThe story here is pretty straightforward:  The apostles made their decision, then Paul, Barnabas, and a couple of new names - Silas and Judas, went around telling everyone what the apostles had decided. That's it, that's all we see in this passage.  \n\nSo what I want to do this morning is what I didn't do last Sunday, I want us to take a look at this command that was being passed around, look at what it actually saying and try to understand it.\n\nSo what does verse 20 say Gentile Christians had to do:  Four things?\n\n* Abstain from pollutions of idols\n* Abstain from fornication\n* Abstain from things strangled\n* Abstain from blood\n\nThat's it.  Seems kind of random right?  Let me explain a little.  \n\nThe first part: pollutions of idols - had to do with polluting your house with idols.  Jews hated idolatry and if you had a bunch of leftover idols in your house and a jew came over - they would have thought that was unclean.  So this is basically saying - get rid of all of your old idols.  It also referred to meat that had been offered to idols.  A lot of the food that gentiles ate would be offered to idols first.  Obviously, jewish people would have a problem with that.\n\nThe third and fourth parts: things strangled and blood.  Those are dietary.  The jews wouldn't eat any meat unless it had been drained.  They considered the meat that gentiles ate unclean because it wasn't properly kosherized.  So the gentile Christians had to make sure that their meat met jewish standards.\n\nSo let's recap: get rid of idols, don't eat meat offered to idols, make sure your meat meets jewish standards.\n\nThe last thing is \"abstain from fornication.\"  This doesn't seem to fit.  There are a lot of explanations for it.  But the one that makes the most sense is that the gentiles lived in a very open society.  They lived in a society where fornication, nudity, adultery etc. were very very common.  People joked about them openly.  Most people didn't see a big deal.\n\nIt's like today.  If you poll most people under 40, the vast majority don't think there is anything wrong with living with someone outside of marriage.  They dress to draw attention to their bodies.  They read magazines about it.  The TV and Movies make it seem like nothing.  \n\nThe greek and roman societies were even worse than ours are about that. So what I think this last thing was saying wasn't just \"don't have sex outside of marriage\" what I think it was saying was \"be really careful about the whole subject.\" \n\nSo the logical question is **why?**  \n\nDoes this mean that we are supposed to eat kosher?  Does this mean that we have to clean out our houses? \n\nThe why of this is really important. \n\nThat brings me to...\n\n## 2. The cause\n\nI think probably the most important verse in this whole chapter is actually verse 21.  James gives this command and then he says:\n\n> *\"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day\"*\n\nThe word \"for there\" signifies that what comes after it is a statement of purpose.  It's like James is saying *20* **\"here is what you need to do\"** and in verse *21* he's saying **\"and here's why.**\"\n\nSo here is the why for the command: because in every city there are synagogues full of people who follow Moses.\n\nDid you catch that?  Read the verse again:\n\n> *\"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day\"*\n\nOk, so what does that tell us about this great command?  Here it is:\n\n> This command isn't about **salvation** (believing the gospel) or **sanctification** (becoming Holy) it's about **evangelism** (or testimony with a lost world.)\n\nYou see, the stated point of this wasn't that you had to do these things to get saved - that was heresy and the apostles dealt with that.  It wasn't that you had to do these things to be holy - we are made holy by Jesus Christ.  We are accepted by Him.  We are clean in him.  The apostle Paul explicitly makes this argument both in 1st Corinthians and in Romans.  \n\nSo this verse and this command has nothing to do with our standing before God and everything to do with our standing before our fellow man.\n\nIn other words, If you were a gentile believer living around jews and trying to witness to them - you would have no chance if you didn't do these things.\n\nThe jews were raised to think that gentiles were gross.  That their houses were full of wicked idols.  That their food was idolatrous.  That they ate and touched unclean things.  So you couldn't lead a jew to the Lord if they wouldn't go near you.\n\nThat's what these commands were all about.\n\nBy the way, we aren't under these commands today.  We aren't under the dietary law.  What God said to Peter still works for us - \"Arise and eat.\"  You don't have to worry about kosher.  You don't have to worry about people thinking your house is ceremonially unclean.  That's Old Testament stuff and we live in the new testament.\n\nThat's never what these commands were about - they were:\n\n1. Telling the gentiles they weren't under the law and were saved by grace \n2. Telling the gentiles they needed to be careful for the sake of the jews around them.\n\nAnd that's really backed up by the way these commands were recieved.\n\nLook at verse 31:\n\n> *\"31 [Which] when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.\"*\n\nWhen the gentiles heard this they rejoiced.  We aren't under the law.  Salvation is by grace.  That's a consoling message.\n\nSo we've looked at the command, we've look at the cause of the command.  Now let's talk for a few minutes about...\n\n## 3. The consequences (lessons for us)\n\nWhat in the world are we - believers who live in the 21st century, who live thousands of years removed from the Old Testament, who live removed from all jewish influence. What are we supposed to get from this passage?  What does this teach us?\n\nI think it teaches us three principles that we can apply to our own rules and our own ways of living.\n\nListen, church, rules are a part of life.  We can't live without rules.  We can't live as anarchists.  God instituted authority in the home, authority in the church, authority in government, authority in the home.  There are going to be rules in every aspect of our life.  So how do we parse those rules?\n\nBefore I get into the lessons here, I want to say that there are two bad attitudes people tend to have that are kind of like the two extremes on this:\n\nOne of them is this **\"You have to obey the rules or you aren't saved.\"**  That's the problem that the people in this passage were dealing with and there are still people who have this attitude today.  \n\nBut the second extreme attitude that we deal with is this **We are Christians now so there is no rules.** This is on the other side of the spectrum and we run into this from time to time.  \n\nMost Christians seem to be someone near one of those sides.  So what do we learn from this passage that helps us with this?\n\nI think the first lesson is this:\n\n### A. God is not out to get you\n\nGod isn't a sadist.  He's not into making you obey rules for the sake of obeying rules.  He's not into adding arbitrary rules that you can't handle.\n\nPeter's question in this chapter really gets to this, he asked \"Are we going to put a yoke on the gentiles that we couldn't handle?\"\n\nPeople have a tendency to make rules an end in themselves.  When they do that it hurts people and makes God look like a monster.\n\nRemember what Jesus said in Mark 2:27? He said *\"The sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath.\"*\n\nOver time in Israel people got the idea that the sabbath was an end in itself and they made the sabbath, which was something awesome God intended to help people into something awful that was a huge burden.  It got to the point that Jesus was being criticized for healing on the sabbath and the disciples were getting criticized for having a snack on the sabbath.\n\nListen folks - no matter what rule God gives us - God has a reason. He isn't out to get you.  His rules aren't arbitrary.  They aren't \"because I said so\" rules.  Behind every rule is a reason and that reason is almost always for our benefit.\n\nThe second lesson from this is...\n\n### B. God wants people to be saved\n\nSalvation is by grace, through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast. \n\nThe biggest problem that the apostles had with this idea of adding judiasim to the gospel is that it would make it almost impossible for gentiles to trust Christ.  \n\nListen folks - salvation is a free gift that God wants people to take.  Salvation is by grace, not by gauntlet\n\nYou can be saved today.  Just trust Christ and His finished work on the cross and He will save you.  He wants to do it.\n\n1 Timothy 2:4 says\n\n> *\"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth\"*\n\nGod WANTS to save people.  We get this idea in our heads sometimes that people have to run through an obstacle course to get to grace - but that's not how Salvation is supposed to work.\n\nGod wants people to get saved.  But the biggest lesson from this passage is...\n\n### C. We should be willing to do things that aren't necessarily wrong for the conscience of others.\n\nRemember - these rules that the apostles gave to the church - they weren't about salvation or holiness - they were about testimony, they were about evangelism.  Peter and James weren't saying that meat offered to idols was inherently sinful.  They weren't saying that meat with blood in it is inherently sinful.  They were saying \"Listen, there are a bunch of jews who think it is - so for their sake - stay away from it so you can reach them.\"\n\nIn other words, they had to give up things that weren't wrong for the good of others.\n\nCan I tell you - that is God's expectation today too.  You might have something that you think is perfectly ok - but it's not ok to your unsaved family member or some Christian who just got saved.  You don't make fun of those people.  You don't flaunt to those people.  You give it up for their sake.\n\nDo you know there are things that I think are perfectly ok - but I won't do because I don't want to be a stumblingblock.  I'll give you an example: I love hot wings.  I like the food at buffalo wild wings.  I like their food a lot.  But do you know what?  I never go into buffalo wild wings.  Is it because it's sinful? No. It's because I don't want lost person driving out of Walmart and watching me go in there and thinking \"There goes that pastor into a bar\" or I don't want some of you who have been saved recently seeing me in there and thinking \"I guess it's ok to go hang out in there.\"  When it would be terrible for them to hang out in there.  Do you get it?\n\nAs believers we aren't supposed to just live on the plane of right and wrong.  We are to live on the plane of \"is this the best thing I can do for God and others?\n",

    "body": "# Mark 4:21-25 - The Secret of Growth \nI’m going to teach you a new word this morning.  It’s one of my favorites.  Are you ready?  The word is:\n\n> Opaque.\n\nHow many of you know what the word “opaque” means?  Some of you?  I find myself using it all the time.  The dictionary defines opaque as:\n\n> not able to be seen through; not transparent.\n\nI first learned the word “opaque” about fifteen years ago when I started messing with Photoshop.  They have a setting called “opacity” that lets you adjust how transparent something is.  If something is 100% opaque, you can’t see through it at all.  If something is 0% opaque, it’s completely see-through. It’s a pretty handy thing in graphic design to be able to make things somewhat see-through.\n\nBut the word “opaque” has a different meaning you hear sometimes.  Its second definition is:\n\n> hard or impossible to understand.\n\nI know absolutely nothing about the way cars work.  If you were to give me a professional mechanics manual for a 2018 Jeep Wrangler, I have a feeling I’d find it opaque.  It wouldn’t mean much to me.  \n\nI know almost nothing about the electrical part of building stuff.  I hear electricians talk about 220 vs. 100, different types of wires, and different types of sockets, and it’s opaque.  I don’t understand it.\n\nI do know a lot about computer programming.  The other day I dropped in on Ayla Pullen’s birthday party and I met her uncle, who happens to be another web programmer.  We immediately started throwing around words like Javascript, Swift, front-end, ES6, Firestore, and I imagine if you were in the room you would find our conversation very opaque.  You wouldn’t understand half of what we were talking about.\n\nSo what does the word *opaque* have to do with our message this morning?  Have you ever felt like God’s word was opaque?  Have you ever felt like Christian teaching was opaque?  You can’t understand it.  It seems like Greek to you.  \n\nHave you ever looked around a church building and thought, “These people all really seem to get what this guy is talking about, but I have no idea; he might as well be talking about stuff from another planet, because I have no clue?”\n\nOur text this morning is actually about this very subject.  It’s about why God’s Word and why Christian teaching seems hard sometimes, and about how you can overcome that hardness and change it from opaque to transparent—from hard to understand to something that seems easy.\n\nThis passage also teaches us an important secret, not just for growing in our knowledge of the Bible, but for growing in our knowledge of anything.  Let’s read the text and we’ll get into that.\n\n> *”21 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 22 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad. 23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. 24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. 25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath. 26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground; 27 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. 28 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear. 29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come. 30 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or with what comparison shall we compare it? 31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth: 32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it. 33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. 34 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.*   (Mark 4:21-34 KJV)\n\nLast week, we looked at the parable of the soils, and we talked about having a receptive heart to the the teaching of God’s Word.  Right after those parables, Jesus gave these parables, which are a little more difficult to understand until you get the key and see what ties them all together:\n\nYou see, this whole chapter has a theme.  Up until this time in Jesus’ ministry, He taught normally.  He taught like I’m teaching now (albeit much, much better).  He taught and explained everything, and He would throw in a story or an illustration here or there to make things clearer.\n\nBut the main point of this chapter is that abruptly, Jesus stopped teaching like that.  Jesus changed His method of teaching completely.  Imagine being one of the disciples, and you are used to hearing Jesus teach over and over and over again. Then suddenly, it’s different.  Suddenly, you are scratching your head and thinking, “All He’s doing today is telling stories, and He’s not explaining them anymore.”\n\nImagine if you came to church one Sunday and instead or preaching normally, I started just spitting out a string of stories that started like, “Walking with God is like this plant…” and I tell you about the plant, but I don’t really explain the connection.  Then I move on and say, “Walking with God is like having a son…” and I tell you a story about a father and son but don’t really explain the connection.\n\nYou’d all be scratching your head and thinking, “Did Pastor lose his marbles?  What’s going on?”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what the disciples did to Jesus.  They noticed immediately that His teaching method was completely different all of a sudden, and that most people weren’t getting it, so they asked Jesus about it.  You see that in verse 11.\n\nThen Jesus explained the parable of the soils and went on to give these parables we just read.  And the theme of these parables is actually a parable in and of itself.  The theme of these is understanding what Jesus is teaching when what Jesus is teaching doesn’t seem to make sense.  And these parables—the candlestick, the measure, the seed, and the mustard seed—all speak to this theme.\n\nWhat I’m going to do this morning is give you three points:\n* I’m going to talk about the problem these verses are addressing;\n* I’m going to explain the promise Jesus gave at the beginning of these verses; and then\n* I’m going to give you three principles for growth and learning you can get from these parables.\n\n***So let’s pray and we’ll jump into this.***\n\nSo listen to these parables again:\n\n* We have a light that is hid under a bushel or a bed.\n* We have someone measuring something to give it away and getting the same amount back.\n* We have two different kinds of seeds being planted and coming back with a big harvest.\n\nHere is what I think these parables were talking about.  The first thing I want you to understand is…\n\n## 1. The problem:\n\nThe problem that Jesus was addressing with these parables is that…\n\n> Some Christian doctrine is difficult, mysterious, and seems impossible to learn.\n\nSome Christian doctrine is opaque, especially when you are a beginner.  It seems impossible to get—impossible to understand.\n\nYou hear a preacher talk about redemption, justification, sanctification, the rapture, and the tribulation, and it makes no sense to you.  Some of the things in the Bible seem downright mysterious.  You read Leviticus or you read Revelation, and you just think, “Huh? What is that?”\n\nJust this week, I was talking to a guy in our church about his Bible reading (I love to hear that kind of stuff by the way), and he was talking about some of the chapters he’s been reading in the Old Testament that he doesn’t get.\n\nIt’s like this for all of us.  Sometimes the Bible just seems hard.   Sometimes Christian teaching just seems hard.  It seems hidden like a lamp under a bushel or like a light under a bed.  We don’t get it.\n\nThese disciples and these listeners were hearing these parables, and it seemed impossible to understand.  It seemed like Jesus was purposely trying to obscure the truth.\n\nThat’s the problem, and to that problem Jesus gave us a promise.  That’s the second point this morning…\n\n## 2. The promise:\n\nJesus was talking about why he was using these mysterious parables, and he said in verse 21:\n\n> *”Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick? 22 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.”*\n\nJesus uses this candlestick and bushel language in the book of Matthew, but I think He’s making a completely different point here.  In Matthew, He was saying we should let our light shine before men, but here He’s talking about His light and His teaching.  The point Jesus was making here is this promise:\n\n> God is not intending to hide or confuse. Some people are just not ready to receive what will be made plain later.\n\nIn other words, the teaching that Jesus was giving these people that made them scratch their head and think, “Huh?” was all going to be explained later on.\n\nI’m going to use a movie as an illustration here.  I hope I don’t offend anyone, but it’s a pretty old movie and I think most of you have probably seen it.  I think this is a bit like the movie, “The Sixth Sense.”   If you’ve never seen the movie, it’s one of those movies where you watch the whole thing, and you think you understand what you are seeing. Then at the very end—literally in the last two minutes of the film—there is a twist. There is a secret that is revealed, and if you go back and you watch the film again, you realize that it was so obvious. It was right there the whole time.\n\nI think the Old Testament is like that.  You read the Old Testament and so much of it seems bizarre, but then you get to the gospels and you see the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus.  You read Romans and you find out what it means.  Then you go back and look at the Old Testament, and suddenly, it means something totally new.  It was right there the whole time; you just needed the key.\n\nSo many of the parables of Jesus seemed mysterious to these people because they didn’t have the key yet.  They didn’t know about Jesus death, burial, and resurrection yet.  They didn’t know about the nature of the kingdom yet.  Even the disciples were clueless.  But after the fact, they could look back and see what Jesus was saying in the light of what happened to Jesus and think, “Oh, I get it now.  It was hidden before, but now it’s clear as a light on a candle.  Jesus wasn’t trying to confuse us.  It’s been revealed now.” \n\nSo what are these parables teaching us?  I think there are three principles that these verses teach us that are great secrets for learning anything.  They are secrets for growth.  \n\nThese principles will help you learn to whatever you want to learn—whether that is woodworking, French, or playing a musical instrument—but they will definitely help you as you seek to learn what the Bible means.\n\n## 3. The principles:\nThe first principle of these verses I’ve already explained to you.  Let’s call it…\n\n## A. The inventory principle.\n\nPut simply…\n\n> Some things you won’t understand now, but if you hold onto them, you’ll get them later.\n\nWhen a kid is first learning the ABCs, they don’t really get the concept.  But they learn that “A says A as in Apple” and “B says B as in Boy,” and they memorize those things.  Then later on, they put them together, and it’s like, “Oh, those were the building blocks of words”.  But they had to get A before they could read “Apple.”\n\nSometimes you learn things in your Bible reading or in a sermon, and at the time, they don’t make sense.  You don’t get it, but you store it away in your mental inventory. Then, later on, you learn something else in the Bible, and it’s like, “Oh, I get it now.”\n\n**The key to learning that this teaches us is we have to keep going.**  We can’t give up in frustration the moment we don’t get something.  We have to push on and trust that we’ll get it later.\n\nWe have to trust that *”For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested.”* We have to trust that God isn’t trying to trick us or keep something a secret, and that we’ll eventually get this.\n\nThat’s the inventory principle. \n\nThe second principle of learning we get from this passage I’m calling…\n\n## B. The investment principle.\nThe investment principle is this:\n\n>  You are only going to get out of something what you put into it.\n\nJesus said:\n\n> *”Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more be given. 25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.”*\n\nListen: If you study the Bible with Netflix on the TV and Facebook open on your phone, then you aren’t going to get much.  If you listen to preaching with your mind half-engaged on work problems or some purchase you want to make, then you aren’t going to get much.  On the other hand, if you dive in and you focus, it will come.\n\nThe key to learning here is **you have to focus; you have to pour yourself into what you are learning; you have to give yourself to it,** and it will come.  But don’t fool yourself into thinking you are going to get much if you aren’t putting anything in.  Life just doesn’t work that way.\n\nAnd this goes for more than just the Bible.  This goes for learning anything.  If you want to master a new skill, learn how to play an instrument, learn a new language, or whatever, then you have to invest yourself into it.  It doesn’t come by osmosis.  You have to study.\n\nSo there’s the inventory principle: Some things you have to hold onto and you’ll understand later.\nThen there’s the investment principle: You have to invest yourself in what you are learning or you won’t get anything out of it.\n\nThe third principle I’m calling…\n\n## C. The initiative principle.\n\nI think this is what Jesus was getting at with the two parables about the seeds and the harvests.  The seed had to be thrown into the ground.  The seed had to be sown, and then later, it brought a harvest.\n\nThe principle I think Jesus was teaching, the initiative principle is this:\n\n> You will never start getting it until you jump in to the deep end.  You have to cast the seed before you get the harvest.\n\nStarting anything difficult is hard.  The other day I was at the mall, and they were having this health fair (I just wanted to see if I could find a cheap tie at Carson’s). I stopped by the CrossFit table, and there was this really buff CrossFit guy sitting there, so we started talking.  As we were talking, I glanced down at the material on the table and I saw this poster which showed this guy who was like 350 pounds. Then they showed the “After” picture, and it was the guy I was talking to.\n\nI thought, “Wow, it’s this guy.  That’s amazing.”  Can you imagine how hard that was to go from this huge, obese guy to being built like Superman?  But the more I thought about it, the more I thought I know what the hardest part was. It was getting started.  It was those first few workouts.  Those first few workouts when he was 350 pounds had to be so unbelievably difficult and disappointing.  That first two weeks had to be killer.\n\nI love running but the first few times I did it, they weren’t fun.  If I hadn’t opened my mouth and told my college buddy I could beat him in a 5k, I don’t think I ever would have finished that first two mile run, and I certainly wouldn’t have gone for a second one.\n\nBut that’s the thing.  No one runs marathons without that first run where they think they are going to die going two miles.  No one builds fine furniture without that first awkward project that kinda sorta resembles a box.  No one becomes a concert pianist without that first awkward time when they are pecking out “Mary Had A Little Lamb.”\n\nThe harvest comes after the commitment.  You always have to take that first awkward step.\n\nAnd that’s the way the Christian life is.  You have to put your faith and trust in Jesus.  You have to commit your life to God.  You have to step out by faith and jump in the deep end of the pool.  You have to sow that seed of faith, and when you do, God brings a harvest.  But you are never going to see that harvest if you are just dipping your toe in the water.\n\nSo we have the inventory principle: Some things you have to hold onto and you’ll understand later.\nThen there’s investment principle: You have to invest yourself in what you are learning or you won’t get anything out of it.\nFinally, there’s the initiative principle: You have to step out by faith and jump in the deep end of the pool.\n\nNow, let me wrap this up by making two quick points of application. \n\n## Conclusions:\n\nThe first is this: **You will never grow as a Christian if you insist on understanding everything before you follow the Lord.**  The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:7: *”For we walk by faith, not by sight.”* The truth is, you can understand the whole Bible, and you still will have to have some faith and follow Jesus.  If you are insisting on God showing you everything before you follow Him, that’s not the way this works, and you’ll never grow in your knowledge and understanding as a Christian.\n\nGod’s Word is a lamp for our feet and a light for our path.  It isn’t a full map and itinerary.  We have to be walking in faith to use it.\n\nThe second thing I want you to understand is this: The key to this whole thing is a relationship with Jesus.  That relationship starts with believing the gospel.  It starts with believing what Jesus did on the cross counts for you and putting your faith and trust in Jesus as your personal savior.\n\nIf you’ve never done that this morning, you will never understand Christianity.  But that’s not the worst of it. The Bible teaches that if you don’t trust Jesus as your Savior, you’ll die in your sins and be judged by a holy God.\n\nSo if you’ve never trusted Christ, why not trust Him today?\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me and turn to 1 Corinthians 15.\n\nI am not an Indianapolis Colts fan. Not by a long shot. I grew up in New England, and have been a New England Patriots fan since I knew what football was.\n\nBut, there are several people from the Colts I’ve had a lot of respect for, and probably none more so than Tony Dungy.\n\nWhen Dungy was coaching, he had a unique coaching philosophy. Most coaches had a big thick playbook. Dungy winnowed the Colts playbook down to the bare essentials. Most coaches are all about teaching their players to think - Dungy was actually about the opposite. He wanted to teach his players to act by habit without thinking.\n\nHere is how Dungy explained his philosophy:\n\n“Champions don’t do extraordinary things, They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they’ve learned.”\n\nI’m not here to talk about football this morning. I’m here to talk about our life and our church. About your Christianity. But I have to say - if you as a church just did the basic stuff every week, ordinary things, if you did them out of habit - our church would be extraordinary and it would make an extraordinary difference in your life.\n\nThis month we are starting off with a little series called “Resolutions: Four Habits to take on in 2017.” I want you to know that there are some things that we as Christians should do without thinking. They should be as natural as walking. As taking out the trash.\n\nThese things are habits - you should do them without thinking. They are priorities - meaning when other stuff comes into conflict with them - they should win.\n\nThese things don’t save you. Only the grace of God does that. They aren’t legalistic things. They are things the Bible makes a big deal about.\n\nLast week, I talked about the habit of faithful church attendance. Today, I want to take that further and add another thing I think should be a habit.\n\nThat is:\n\nHabitual, prioritized ministry service.\n\nI think that every Christian should be faithfully serving in a ministry and that that ministry should be a very big priority to them.\n\nThat might sound strange to you. You might think that ministry is just for “ministers”; for pastors and missionaries and evangelists. If you think that way - you are very far off from what we see in the scripture. Ministry is for every Christian.\n\nChristianity is not a spectator sport. It’s not something you just take in passively every Sunday morning at 10:30. No! God wants you off of the sideline and onto the field. God wants everyone to be involved. Everyone has a purpose. Every member is a minister.\n\nNow, let’s go to the Bible and we’ll see this. My text this morning is going to be a familiar one. We even used it as our church theme a couple of years ago. The text is 1 Corinthians 15:58 which says:\n\n”Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”\n\nHabitual, prioritized ministry service. That’s what this verse is calling for.\n\nWhat I want to do this morning is simply go through this one verse and break it down, and look at the case it makes for habitual, prioritized ministry service.\n\nWe are just going to ask this verse some questions - we are going to interrogate it - and see what answers it gives us. Just the basic questions “Who, what, when, how and why” - So that will be our outline this morning.\n\nLet’s get started with the:\n\nWho: (- The church)\nWho is supposed to be doing habitual, prioritized ministry involvement. Let’s look at that verse again:\n\n”Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”\n\nThis verse was written to a church. Not to the leadership of the church. Not to the ministers. But to the church people. It was written to be read during a church service like this one. Basically it was a sermon.\n\nSo, the “beloved brethren” that it’s referring to is the members of that church. They were to be ”always abounding in the work of the Lord.”\n\nChurch, I cannot stress this enough. I know I mentioned it last week but I’m going to mention it again and again. God wants everyone in the church to be ministering. God has a ministry for you.\n\nLook, last week we looked at Romans 12 where it talks about how we are all members and have to minister to the other members. Let’s look at a different passage this morning. Turn back to 1 Corinthians 12 and lets read verses 20-23:\n\n”[1Co 12:20-23 KJV] 20 But now [are they] many members, yet but one body. 21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: 23 And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.”\n\nYou, as a saved and called out member of a church, are a body part. Each body part has a purpose. Each has a job. All of them are necessary. Thats what these verses are teaching.\n\nWe could look at other passages too. The Bible very clearly teaches that everyone who is saved is given a spiritual gift for ministry. You can read about that in Romans 12:6-8, Here in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, and in 1 Peter 4:11.\n\nIf you’ve been saved - then has left you here for a reason. You have work to do. That’s for everyone.\n\nSo the next question - after “who” is “what?”\n\nWhat: -\nLook at our verse again:\n\n”Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”\n\nNotice it says we are to be “always abounding in the work of the Lord”. The what of Habitual, prioritized ministry service is “the work of the Lord.”\n\nSo, the natural question is “what is the work of the Lord?”\n\nThe bible gives us a couple of answers for that question:\n\nFirst, the “work of the Lord” is evangelism. Jesus said in Luke 19:10\n\n”For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.”\n\nThe heart of our Lord and the heart of Christ is to see souls saved. God is after sinners. That’s why, when He chose His disciples, He said “I will make you fishers of men if you follow me.”\n\nThat’s why He said in Luke 5:32:\n\n”I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”\n\nThat is why, they last thing Jesus did before He ascended into heaven was to give Christians a commission:\n\n”Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”\n\nThe work of the Lord is the work of saving the lost, of calling sinners to repentance, of teaching all nations the gospel. It’s what we call “evangelism.”\n\nChurch - I’ve got to say it again - that’s not just the work of the pastor or the deacons or the evangelist. The whole church is supposed to be involved in this.\n\nThe second thing I think is “the work of the Lord” is the work of building churches. Jesus said\n\n”And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”\n\nWhen we see the early church in Acts, they were going around the world starting churches and building churches.\n\nWhen I say “building churches” I’m not talking about the buildings. I’m talking about building up people. About edifying the church.\n\nSo what is the “work of the Lord for you?”\n\nIt is whatever God has gifted you to do to advance his work of evangelism and edification.\n\nOk, the next question to ask about habitual, prioritized ministry service is...\n\nWhen:\nWhen are you supposed to do this “work of the Lord?”\n\nWell, what does our text say?\n\n”Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”\n\nSo, when are we supposed to be doing “the work of the Lord” church?\n\nRight...always.\n\nI don’t know what that means, but I know what it doesn’t mean. It doesn’t mean “occasionally.” It doesn’t mean “when I feel like it.” It doesn’t mean “when I have nothing better going on.”\n\nThis is why I said this should be habitual. It should be something we are doing by default. Something we should be doing all the time.\n\nAlways.\n\nHabitual, prioritized ministry service.\n\nSo, we’ve asked Who, what and when. Let’s ask...\n\nHow:\nHow are we supposed to be serving? Look at the text again:\n\n”Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”\n\nThere are two ways this text teaches us we should be serving.\n\nFirst, we should be serving...\n\nSteadfastly\nIt says be ye stedfast, unmovable.\n\nThose words are synonyms. They basically both mean “unmovable.”\n\nWhenever you see two words that mean the same thing like that - that’s done for emphasis. God is trying to make a point.\n\nThe point is, not only does God want us to be involved in ministry, he wants us to be tenacious about it. He wants us to keep at it even when many other people would easily quit.\n\nLook folks, there will people who will go out running when it’s 0 degrees outside (I’m one of them.) They are so stedfast in their commitment to marathon training they’ll go out and run when most sane people won’t even check the mail. There are people who are so committed to a sport that they’ll wake up at 4am to practice, then practice again when they get home from work. Nothing stops them.\n\nGod wants us to be stedfast in the ministry. Nothing stops us. We’re like the Energizer bunny you know - you can’t stop the copper top. We just keep trudging through. We are unmovable. Stedfast.\n\nDo you know, I can’t remember a single lesson I learned in Sunday School. Not a single one. I mean, I must have heard 1000s of them. I can’t remember one. But do you know what I do remember? I remember Scott Hasset, my 5th and 6th grade teacher, always had a lesson prepared. Always had a game for us. He worked long hours on his job - yet he was unmovable. He was stedfast. That made a much bigger impact on me than anything Scott Hasset ever said to a 10 year old kid.\n\nFind out what God wants you to do in his work and be stedfast at it. Hang onto with some tenacity. Like a dog that’s got ahold of a steak, you determine that it’s your ministry and you are going to hang onto it.\n\nBut there is a second thing this verse teaches us about how we are supposed to be ministering. It says\n\n“Always abounding in the work of the Lord.”\n\nWe should be stedfast, but we should also be abounding.\n\nDo you know what “abounding” means? It means “more than enough.” Enough is a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, abounding is Thanksgiving dinner. Enough is a two door 1993 Plymouth Sundance, abounding is a new Cadillac. Enough is doing the bare minimum, abounding is throwing your heart into it and doing it for the Lord.\n\nGod doesn’t just want you to find a ministry and be stedfast in it, He wants you to abound in it. To give your very best.\n\nListen, if God has you cleaning the toilets- it that’s your ministry - be the best at it you possibly can be. If God has you teaching 2 year old Sunday School, be the best 2 year old Sunday School Teacher ever (actually, be the best teacher of two year olds in Sunday School ever - we don’t need two year old sunday school teachers.)\n\nDon’t just do it - abound in it.\n\nAnd do you know what I think would have a huge impact on your witness for Christ - take that same attitude toward your job. Don’t just be a fork truck driver - be the best fork truck driver you can be. Don’t just be a bank teller - be the best you can be. View it as a ministry and abound in it.\n\nSo we’ve talked about Who, What, When, and how. Let’s look at one more thing about habitual, prioritized ministry service:\n\nWhy:\nWhy in the world would you give up your time and commit not only to coming to church - but to involving yourself in the ministry?\n\nI mean, you have better things to do. You have ball games. You could sleep in. You could take more vacations. You could get together with your friends. So why?\n\nI think this passage gives us three reasons why we should be abounding and stedfast in serving God. Why we should make service a habit.\n\nLook at the verse one more time:\n\n”Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.”\n\nThis verse starts with an important word. It says “Therefore.” I had a teacher in school that used to say “Anytime you see the word therefore, you need to stop and find out what the therefore is there for.” That’s good advice.\n\nSo if you look up to the passage before this, it gives us a couple reasons why we should be always abounding. Look at verses 51-57:\n\n”[1Co 15:50-57 KJV] 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. 51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal [must] put on immortality. 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 55 O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory? 56 The sting of death [is] sin; and the strength of sin [is] the law. 57 But thanks [be] to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”\n\nThese verses give us two reasons to be involved in habitual, prioritized ministry service. The first is:\n\nBecause we will someday answer to God (and we don’t know when.)\nIt says in the moment, in the twinkling of an eye, we are going to be in the presence of Jesus. Other passages teach us that we will give an account for how we’ve lived our lives.\n\nDon’t you want to be doing something worthwhile when your master comes back? Don’t you want to have something to show to Him?\n\nThat’s a motivation.\n\nThe second motivation for being involved in service is also found in these verses and it is...\n\nBecause God has given us the victory.\nVerse 57 says God “gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” If God has given us victory, doesn’t it make sense to do His work? Isn’t that reasonable service?\n\nBut I think the biggest reason why we should be committed to habitual, prioritized ministry service is found at the end of our text verse where it says\n\n”forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.”\n\nThe last reason why you should make this a resolution, why you should make serving God a priority and a habit in your life is...\n\nBecause it really matters.\nCan I give you my testimony and we’ll close. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with politics. My first paying job was as an intern for the Dan Quayle campaign. I helped manage a database of voters and got to ride around with a bunch of Ivy League campaign workers all the time. I would even get calls when I was at school and the school secretary would come in.\n\nBut I knew in my heart that God wanted me to serve Him and I knew politics wasn’t for me. But I wanted it sooo bad.\n\nOne day at the office I was working with one of the most respected politicians in our state. He was the retired Mayor of New Hampshire’s biggest city. He’d run for governor. He also happened to be a very godly man and a Christian. One day we were licking stamps or something and he said to me that I would do far more good for the world as a preacher than I would as a politician.\n\nThat helped me. Then I heard a preacher say this one sentence in a sermon and it pushed me over the edge - he said “Do you want to spend the rest of your life making the world a better place to go to hell from?”\n\nLook, I’m not trying to turn you into a preacher. I’m just trying to tell you that this stuff is of eternal consequence. This stuff isn’t in vain. It matters.\n\nAnd let me close by saying this - it’s fulfilling. When you see the kids you taught in Sunday School grow up and bring their kids to church - that’s fulfilling. When you see someone kneel on the carpet you cleaned the day before and trust Christ as their savior - that’s fulfilling. When you pull someone back from the edge...you get the point.\n\nSo I want to close by saying “Just find a way to serve God and get in on His work, and don’t let go of it.”\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "# Go Kit - 5\nLesson Aims:\n* To discover the opportunity and obligation of prayer in the life of a Christian witness\n* To learn the secret of praying the scriptures\n* To begin to pray definitely and consistently for that which is on the heart of Christ - souls.\n\nOpening Illustrations:\n* Acts 10 - Cornelius was praying for a witness, Peter was in prayer.  God brought them together.\n* Forest Chen - Chinese student praying that God would show himself to him literally bumps into Scott Pauley witnessing on the campus of UT.\n\nGod has a way of using people who were intercessors for others:\n* In Genesis 18 Abraham interceded for Sodom.\n* In Exodus 32 Moses interceded for Israel to be spared.\n* The greatest example of an intercessor was Christ, who interceded for us at Gathsemene and on the cross.  Isaiah 53:12 says Jesus *“made intercession for transgressors”*\n\nThe dictionary defines intercessor as:\n> a person who intervenes on behalf of another, especially by prayer.\n\nOur text tonight shows us the heart of an intercessor: Paul.  Look at Romans 9:1-5 tonight:\n\n> *”1 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost, 2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart. 3 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 4 Who are Israelites; to whom [pertaineth] the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service [of God], and the promises; 5 Whose [are] the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ [came], who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.”* (Romans 9:1-5)\n\nIn this chapter Paul is laying it out there.  He really wants to see his countrymen get saved.  He wants to see his countryman saved so much he even says he wishes he could go to hell for them.   \n\nDo you feel that way sometimes about your family, your friends, your coworkers?\n\nLast year I had to preach my grandfathers funeral in Massachusetts, and I tried to give a clear gospel presentation and it really broke my heart to see many of my cousins and aunts and uncles who have no solid profession of faith.\n\nSo what do you do about it?  Look at Romans 10.  Romans 10 is the main passage in “the romans road.”  It’s the passage that talks about calling on the name of the Lord and being saved.  But look how it starts:\n\n> *”1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. 3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ [is] the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”*\n\nI have highlighted in my Bible the words **”my hearts desire and prayer to God** and then **that they might be saved.**\n\nWhat do you pray about?  Sometimes are prayers, which should be us at our most spiritual, actually reveal our selfishness.  \n\nTonight we are going to talk about praying for lost people, and specifically there are three things you should pray for:\n\n## 1. Pray for the lost to be saved.\n\nWhen we pray, God works!\n\nI want you to think about the folks who have been saved in our church in recent years.  Every single one of them was saved during a time when we were really praying.  I mean crying out to God on their behalf.\n\nIn the Old Testament, God actually setup a whole tribe to pray for the spiritual needs of Israel night and day - the Levites.  We are all priests, it is all of our job to bring people before God and bring God before people. \n\nSpecifically, there are several ways we should pray…\n\n### A. Pray for the advancement of the gospel.\n* Pray for open doors.\n\nWe ought to pray for opportunities and open doors to share the gospel with others.  Look at 1 Timothy 2:1-6:\n\n> *”1 I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, [and] giving of thanks, be made for all men; 2 For kings, and [for] all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 3 For this [is] good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 5 For [there is] one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; 6 Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.”*\n\nWe think of this as the “pray for politicians” passage - but this is actually a soul winning passage.  We are supposed to be praying for all men, then living a life that witnesses to others.  \n\nNotice the heart of God here: *”who would have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth”*. God wants to see people saved and He’s told us to pray to that end.\n\nWe need to pray for open doors and also to…\n\n* Pray for open hearts.\n\nI believe the gospel is simple and salvation is as easy as believing and trusting in the death burial and resurrection of Christ, but I also believe that that simple thing is hard for people and that the Holy Spirit has to get involved.  2 Corinthians 4:4 says:\n\n> *”In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.”*\n\nPeople are blinded and they need their spiritual eyes opened by the Spirit of God.  So we should pray that God would give us open doors and open hearts.\n\n\n\n### B. Pray for gospel to be given in power.\n\nA priest had two main responsibilities: He was an intermediary who spoke to men for God and who spoke to God for men.  \n\nIn prayer we speak to God for men.  In witnessing we speak to men for God.  Both are essential.\n\nWhen you are speaking to men about God you should:\n\n* **Pray before you go** - Pray that the Holy Spirit would prepare their heart.\n* **Pray as you go** - Ask God to use you as you sow the gospel and claim the promise that God’s word will not return void.\n* **Pray after you go** - Water the seed you sow with your prayers.\n\nIllustration: George Mueller’s five friends.\n\n## 2. Pray for laborers to be sent.\n\nDid you Jesus only shared one prayer request?\n\nMatthew 9:38\n\n> *”Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.”*\n\n### A. Pray that the Lord would send more laborers.\n### B. Pray for the laborers that are already sent.\n\nThat’s one reason we bring a missionary before you every Wednesday.\n\nThis is Biblical.  Look at Romans 15:30:\n\n> *”Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;”*\n\nWe might not ever get to go to Thailand or to Germany or to Peru, but we can have a part in their ministry through prayer.  We can work with them in prayer.\n\n## 3. Pray for the Lord to use you.\n\nIt’s kind of hypocritical for us to pray that God will use others if we aren’t willing for God to use us.  It’s hypocritical to pray and not be willing to obey.\n\nCharles Spurgeon said this:\n\n> If you have no desire for others to be saved, then you are not saved yourself, be sure of that.\n\n* Pray that you will be a usable vessel\n* Yield yourself\n* Ask for divine appointments\nYou cannot witness to the wrong person, but we do see times in the scripture where God setup “divine appointments”.  (Phillip and the Ethiopian Eunich, Jesus and the woman at the well, etc.)\n\n\n# Lesson Application\n* Create a prayer list of the people who you know that need to be saved.  Begin to pray for their salvation every day.\n* Ask another believer to be your prayer partner.  \n* Write a letter or make a visit to someone you are praying for.\n\nEncouraging illustration - someone in our church recently asked me to pray as they had setup a meeting with someone specifically to witness to them.  I wish I got more prayer requests like that!",

    "body": "# The Religious Solemnity Complex\nTake your Bibles again and turn to Mark 2.  Our text this morning is going to be verses 18-22.\n\nLast week, I started a new series I’m calling “The Four Dysfunctions of Religious Conservatives.”  \n\nI am a religious conservative.  No one would deny that.  Almost all of you would fit the same description.   We believe the Bible is the very word of God.  We believe the Bible should be our sole authority in faith and practice.  We actually go to church.   We give to the church.  We are kind of old school.\n\nAnd one of the most shocking things in the gospels is that the biggest bad guys in the stories of Jesus weren’t the worldly crowd, and they weren’t the religious liberals.  They were the very conservative religious crowd of their day: the Pharisees.  They were religious conservatives.  They were us.\n\nLast week, I told you about the beginning of the Pharisees.  They started as a revival movement.  They started as a “Back to the Bible” movement.  Over centuries, they stood firm for the faith even when invaded and persecuted.  They knew the Bible better than anyone else, and they were determined to be teaching and living it.  If you step back from the gospels and just look at the history, there is a lot to like about the Pharisees.\n\nAnd yet, for all the Pharisees had going for them, they were monsters.  They made life miserable.  They caused all kinds of problems.  They opposed Jesus at every turn.\n\nSo the question I want us to consider this month as we look at Mark 2 is: How do conservative religious people—people who love the Bible and are trying to please God—become monsters?  What went wrong?  How would Jesus live differently?\n\nLet’s make it personal: How could we become monsters?  How could we turn the Bible into a prison, and, no matter how well intentioned, how could we turn religion into a sickness?\n\nI think we see four answers to that in Mark 2—what I’m calling “The Four Dysfunctions of Religious Conservatives.”    We see these four things when we notice a contrast between these conservative religious Pharisees and Jesus.\n\nLast week, I gave you the first way we can be religious monsters: By getting a superiority complex; by looking down at the world around us.\n\nLet’s look at our text this morning and see a second way:\n\n(Mark 2:18-22)\n\n> *”18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? 19 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. 20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. 21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. 22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.”*\n\nThe second dysfunction of religious conservatives I see in this chapter is what I’m calling the “religious sorrow complex.”  Before I can explain what that is, I need to show you what was going on in these verses.\n\nIn our text last week, the Pharisees accused Jesus of eating with publicans and sinners.  In our text this week, they did something different. They were attacking Him because Jesus and His disciples didn’t fast.\n\nNow we know right away that that isn’t true.  Jesus fasted for forty days.  Jesus taught about fasting in the Sermon on the Mount.  Jesus isn’t anti-fasting, so what were these Pharisees talking about?  How could they accuse Jesus and the disciples of not fasting?\n\nThe Old Testament only commanded one fast day per year for the Jews.  You could be a faithful, Bible-following Jew and fast only on the Day of Atonement.  That was the only requirement.   It was just one day per year.  Of course, people were allowed to fast more than that, but it was between them and God.  It wasn’t mandatory.\n\nBut, by the time Jesus had come around, the Pharisees had this tradition of fasting twice a week every week.  On Mondays and Thursdays, they wouldn’t eat all day (until after dark).  They would make a big show of it, too.  They wouldn’t wash their faces, and they would just try to look miserable.   It was a point of pride for them.\n\nJesus and His disciples didn’t play that game.  It’s not that they didn’t fast. They did. They just didn’t make a big show of it and didn’t do it twice a week every week.  They didn’t go around trying to look miserable and sad.  \n\nActually, they looked *happy.*  They had *joy*.  This really bothered the Pharisees, so they asked Jesus about it.\n\nThey said: \n\n> *”Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? ”*\n\nJesus gave them two answers.\n\nFirst, Jesus compared His disciples to a wedding party.  \n\nIn Jesus’ day, a wedding party was a big deal.  It was a week long!  It was a week of nonstop joy and happiness.  If you were a part of the official wedding party, then it was supposed to be one of the happiest weeks of your life.  This was such a big deal that the rabbis granted an official break from all religious requirements for wedding parties.  \n\nSo Jesus was saying that while He was around, it was supposed to be happy.  It was supposed to be a time of joy.  When He went to the cross and when He was put in the grave, then there would be a time for fasting and mourning, but as long as Jesus was around, this was a time for joy.\n\nJesus’ second answer was to compare Himself to new cloth and new wine.  \n\nNew cloth shrinks, so if you patch really old clothes with cloth that hasn’t shrunk yet, it’s going to shrink up and break your clothes.  \n\nIn Jesus’ day, they would put grape juice in goatskin bottles.  As the grape juice aged, it would expand and stretch the bottles.  If you put new grape juice in old bottles that were already stretched out, it would break the bottles.\n\nSo Jesus was saying that He came to bring something completely new, and that their old religious system wouldn’t be able to hold it. Jesus wasn’t a patch to the religion these guys practiced, and Jesus wouldn’t fit in the bottle of their constrictive religion system.  Jesus was bringing something new and something that was characterized by joy and gladness.\n\nSo what does this little episode teach us about the Pharisees?  What possible pitfall for religious people do we see here?\n\nLast week, I told you the first dysfunction of religious conservatives we see in this chapter is a superiority complex—looking down on people.  In this little story, we see something else. I’m calling it a solemnity complex.\n\nHere is a definition:\n\n> **The religious solemnity complex is the belief that God doesn’t want us to be happy and joyous, and that we are only holy if we are miserable and serious all the time.**\n\nNow I know you’ve met very fine religious people—people who are serious about God—who walk around all the time like they are sucking on persimmons.  \n\n“How are you doing, brother?“\n\n“Oh, I’m suffering, but I’m getting through.”\n\nThere are people who can never be happy without feeling guilty about it.  They think that if there is anything that brings them joy in life, it must be worldly and must be forsaken.  They think that if they laugh, they may have just committed a sin.  They are spiritual Eeyores.\n\nThat’s bad enough, but these spiritual Eeyores take it further.  They don’t just live miserably. They try to please God by inventing forms of sacrifice and hardship that He never prescribed.  In other words, they try to make God’s commands in the Bible harder and tougher.  \n\nThat’s what I think was going on with these Pharisees. I’m calling it the religious sorrow complex.  \n\nSo let me pray this morning, and I’ll give you a couple of principles from the Bible that will help us overcome this religious sorrow complex.\n\n**Let’s pray**\n\nThe first thing I want you to understand about this idea of being sorrowful and uncomfortable for Jesus is...\n\n## 1. God is good and all of his laws are intended for our flourishing.\n\nThomas Paine is a guy whom most Americans know as the one who wrote the pamphlet “Common Sense” that helped spark the American Revolution, but Thomas Paine was actually a vehement anti-religion writer in his day.  He was like his generation’s Richard Dawkins or Christopher Hitchens.  He hated God, and he hated religion.\n\nPaine grew up in a very strict Quaker family and ran as far from that kind of life as he possibly could.   I was reading years ago, and I read one sentence that from Paine that really made me think.  He said:\n\n> If the god of the quakers had invented the flowers, they would come in only black and white.\n\nThink about that.  As a young boy, Paine looked at the conservative religious people around him and thought that their God was someone who just wanted to suck all the life out of life.  Their God was someone who wanted to enforce a bland and colorless existence.\n\nI think a lot of Christians believe in their heart that God is a grumpy old man who wants to take all of the joy and gladness out of their lives—no smiling; no fun; no enjoyment.  \n\nThey believe that God’s laws are designed to make us “holy,” and their idea of “holy” is 50% “weird” and 50% “miserable.”\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.  God is good, and God’s laws and requirements for us are good. They are designed for our benefit and happiness.  We’ll talk more about this next week, but let me briefly say that God knows better than us about what we need to be truly happy and joyful. We as religious people have this sick tendency to take God’s laws and twist and distort them. We make them stricter than God intended and suck the joy out of life.\n\nListen, folks: God isn’t anti-fun.  God invented fun.  God invented joy.  The reason we have this amazing variety of tastes and food is because God put them here for our enjoyment.  \n\nGod isn’t anti-creativity.  The reason why we have these creative minds is because our Heavenly Father was the Creator, and we are made in His image.  \n\nGod isn’t anti-humor.  I believe God has a sense of humor.  I mean, come on, remember the story of Balaam’s donkey.  God had to be laughing about that one.  I don’t think that Jesus spent His time on this earth walking around completely solemn all the time, never smiling, never laughing, just 100% percent serious.  \n\nGod isn’t anti-romance or anti-sex.  The reason why we have romance and family is because God gave them to us to enjoy.  Read Song of Solomon sometime.   God’s not against that stuff.  It has its proper place, but He’s not against it.\n\nIf you believe living for God is accepting a life of gray colorless misery, then you don’t know God.  If you believe that God’s laws are God’s way of enforcing misery into our lives, then you really don’t understand the Bible.\n\nGod isn’t anti-joy, anti-happiness, or anti-life.  God wants you to live a life of joy and happiness, and to live a full and fulfilling life.  He just knows the best way for that to happen, and that you, left to your own devices, will mess it up.\n\nA second point I want to make about this this morning is...\n\n## 2 . God derives no joy from our self-inflicted misery.\nIn the Middle Ages, there was this movement called monasticism.  Men would become monks, separate themselves from the rest of mankind, and try to live as miserably as possible.  They would starve themselves or only eat the blandest and distasteful of foods, and take years long oaths of silence. Some of them even made these shirts out of hair specifically designed to be as uncomfortable as possible.  They did all of this believing that it pleased God.\n\nI don’t think God derives any joy from us making ourselves miserable in the name of religion.   I don’t think it makes God happy at all.\n\nThere are people who are always giving things up for God.  They enjoy bowling, so they are going to give up bowling for God.  They enjoy reading and gardening, so they are going to give up reading or gardening for God.  They enjoy pizza, so they they are going to give up pizza for God. \n\nYou get the idea.  I don’t think that kind of thing makes God happy at all.  Now there may be a time to give up bowling, pizza, or gardening if it’s becoming a god in your life—if you need to give it up for self-discipline—but don’t think that the act of denying yourself things God has given us to enjoy makes Him especially pleased with you.\n\nMost of that stuff is legalism.  Most if it is trying to please God by our works.  Most of it only makes sense in context of trying to work your way into God’s good graces.\n\nTurn with me to 1 Timothy 4 and we’ll read verses 1-5.  1 Timothy 4:1-5 says:\n\n> *”1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;”* \n\nSo false teachers will come in the last days and speak lies and the doctrines of devils.  What are these doctrines?  Keep reading.\n\n> *“3 Forbidding to marry, [and commanding] to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. 4 For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: 5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.”*\n\nDo you see it?  God isn’t against the good of this earth.  It needs to be kept in perspective.  It shouldn’t rule over us, but He wants us to receive it with thanksgiving.\n\nOkay, so you might be saying, “What about sacrifice?  What about all of the sacrifices in the Old Testament?  What about Abraham giving up Isaac?”  Wasn’t that people making themselves miserable for God’s sake?\n\nThat brings me to my next point:\n\n## 3. Jesus satisfied God’s demand for sacrifice.\n\nEvery sacrifice in the Old Testament was pointing to Jesus.  They were all a picture of Him.  When Jesus died on the cross and rose again, that did away with any need for a sacrifice.  Nothing else had to die for God to be satisfied.\n\nThe pagans were always cutting themselves and sacrificing their children, thinking that this made their gods happy and pleased with them.  \n\nBut listen to this and hear this: **We don’t have to try to make God happy.**  We don’t have to work, make ourselves miserable, or give, give, give in order to win God’s favor.  God’s favor was earned through the death of Jesus Christ.\n\nIf you are suffering through church, giving, or keeping your life clean because you think that will make God happy with you—because you think that will somehow tip the scales in your favor—you are doing good things for the wrong reason.  Nothing you do is going to be enough to erase your sin and please God.  I repeat: Nothing.\n\nThe only hope we have is in what Jesus did for us.\n\nGalatians 2:16 says:\n\n> *”Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.”*\n\nEphesians 2:8-9 says:\n\n> *”8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: [it is] the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.”*\n\nGod is satisfied through what Jesus did for you.  In other words, Jesus took the test and passed for you.  Jesus paid the debt for you.\n\nLet me give you one more point and then I’ll wrap this up.\n\n## 4. Everything we do for Jesus should be done out of gratitude and joy.\n\nThe New Testament talks about rejoicing 41 times.  \n\nPhilippians 4:4 says:\n\n> *”Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.”*\n\n1 Thessalonians 5:16 says:\n\n> *”Rejoice evermore.”*\n\n1 Peter 1:8 talks about rejoicing with *”joy unspeakable and full of glory.”*\n\nMany, many times the New Testament talks about having *joy.* Joy is one of the fruits of the Spirit.  All of our faith is supposed to be characterized by *“righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.”*\n\nThe Christian life isn’t “I have to make myself miserable so that God will be happy with me.”  It is “God is happy with me in Jesus, so let’s live for God in joy.”\n\n# Conclusion\nSo let me wrap this up by asking you a couple of questions:\n\nThe first question I want to ask is: **Are you still trying to please God with your works as a way to go to heaven?**\n\nBecause if you are, you either haven’t been saved or you don’t understand your salvation.  Jesus did that for you.  All He asks you to do is believe in Faith.  *”Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved.”*\n\n\nThe second question is for the rest of us: **Do others see your Christian walk and see joy or do they see self-imposed misery?**\n\nIn other words, do you give the impression that the only way to be holy is to be miserable?  \n\nLet me ask you another question: What kind of message do you think that is sending about our God?  Why would anyone want to serve a God that takes pleasure in you being sad?  \n\nLook at Jesus here.  He and His disciples were so happy and so full of life that they offended the grumpy religious people of the day.  Let’s be like Jesus and forever get rid of this idea that God wants us to be miserable for Him.",

    "body": "I want you to imagine for a second, that I had a cure for cancer.  I mean this cure worked 100% of the time.  It instantly cured people of the cancer that they had and acted as an immunization for all future forms of cancer.  It was proven time and again over hundreds of years.  Everyone who took it was healed and there are many high profile cases of using it that seem downright miraculous.  \n\nHere’s the paradox:  Now imagine that everyone hates this cure.  Most people refuse to touch it.  The medical community turns it’s nose up at it.  There are doctors who make fun of anyone who uses this cure and they mock the people who have been healed by it.\n\nWe are going to look at a familiar verse this morning - probably the best known “I AM” statement of Jesus.  A verse that many of our children memorize when they are very young.  A verse many of you could quote from memory.  \n\nIt is the most blessed news that anyone could give...it is like the cure for cancer.  It is miraculous.  It works every time.  It gives people what they are really yearning for and wanting in their heart and at the same time it is the most despised and hated thing on this earth.\n\nIt’s a paradox...but it is the truth.  And we as Christians - real Christians - are nothing more than people who believe this simple statement of Jesus.  Look, you’ll be mocked for it.  You’ll be despised.  Most people won’t want to hear it.  But it is still amazing and true and miraculous.\n\nLet’s look at our text.  John 14.  So far we’ve looked the following “I am” statements of Jesus:\n\n* I am the bread of life\n* I am the light of the world\n* I am the door\n* I am the good shepherd\n* I am the resurrection and the life\n\nAnd now we are on to the sixth of seven statements in John 14:6, stand with me and we will all read it out loud together (Use the screen if you have to):\n\n> *”6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”*\n\nLet’s do that one more time:\n\n> *”6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”*\n\nThis verse that is really the heart of Christianity.  I mean, if you were to describe Christianity in one short sentence, it would be hard to do better than this statement.  Christianity is all about following Jesus and believing that He is the answer to all of these things.\n\nIt’s also super good news.  I mean, it’s the best news anyone could get.  It’s like a treasure map to happiness and fulfillment and purpose.  It is the answer to all of the worlds problems.  \n\nAnd at the same time, it’s the most hated message in the whole world.  This is not “how to win friends and influence people” message.  Believing and preaching this message will not get you a job on Wall Street or anchoring the evening news.  It is a message that is not welcome on college campuses and a message that more and more is not welcome in Washington D.C..  \n\nIt is the simple message of Jesus, let’s read it one more time:\n\n> *”6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”*\n\nLet’s have a word of prayer and then I’m going to give you two main points this morning explaining the message of this verse.  \n\n*Let’s pray*\n\n---\n\nLike I said, I think that this verse is making two simple points for us so that’s going to be our outline.  The first point that the verse is making is...\n\n# Jesus is everything that people are looking for.\nWhen Jesus said that He is “the way, the truth and the life” that is awesome news.  Because those are three of the primary things that people are looking for.\n\nPeople all over the world are yearning for direction.  Every one of us has this question burning in our mind: ‘Who am I and where I am supposed to go?”  We want direction.  We want to know what we are supposed to do and where we are supposed to go and how we are supposed to get there.\n\nAnd to that Jesus says “I am the way.”\n\nI am your direction.  If you want to figure out who you really are...follow Jesus.  If you want to figure out what you are supposed to do...just follow Jesus.  If you want to know where you are going and how you are supposed to get there...just follow Jesus.\n\nThe heart of Christ’s expectation for us is just “follow me.”  That’s the message that JEsus preached to all his disciples:  Peter and James and John were fishing and Jesus said “Follow Me”, Matthew was collecting taxes and Jesus said “Follow me.”  That’s his message to you - “follow me.”  *I am the way.*\n\nIf you’ve ever started a new job that you’ve never done before you can remember how overwhelmed you were on that first day.  You likely got through it because the manager had you work with someone and just said “for the next couple days, follow that guy and do everything he does.”  And you got it.\n\nWe travel quite a bit and sometimes we will be in a strange city and we have no idea where we are but we don’t worry about it because we have this little box on our dashboard that is just saying “Follow me and I’ll get you there.”\n\nIf you just follow Jesus, He’ll take care of you.\n\nYou say “Pastor, that sounds simplistic.  That sounds too easy.”  Yep.  Christianity is simple and Christianity is easy.  That’s why Jesus said that you had to have the faith of a child to accept it.\n\nIt reminds me of a story from the Old Testament.  There was this Syrian general named Naaman.  I mean, he was on top of the world.  He was a big shot.  Conqueror.  Man’s man.  You know.  But the problem was Naaman got leprosy.  He woke up one day and saw the spots that he knew meant he was going to die a terrible death and soon be separated from everything he knew.  \n\nBut Naaman had a little servant girl who knew a prophet and the little girl was brave enough to tell him about this miracle working prophet so Naaman secretly went to him for a cure to his leprosy.  Do you know what that prophet told Naaman to do?  Go dunk himself in the nasty Jordan River seven times.  \n\nWhat? Just wash in that plain old dirty water seven times?  It has to be harder than that.  There has to be more to it than that.  Naaman got angry but his servant told him he should at least try it and do you know what?  It worked, God miraculously healed him.\n\nA lot of people look at Jesus like Naaman probably looked at Elisha’s instructions.  That’s too easy.  That’s too simple.  You have to be a simpleton or a fool to do something like that.  That’s intellectual suicide.  But Jesus says “I am the way.”\n\nDo you think the world knows the way?  Look at the heroes of this world.  Look at the pro athletes.  They make millions to toss a football or a baseball around and most of them - a huge percentage of them - end up dirt poor.  Many of them end up in rehab or in jail.\n\nLook at the movie stars - if a movie star stays married more than a couple of years it’s a marvel.  Most of them are in and out of rehab and addicted to drugs and they are miserable people.  Every year one of them takes their life or dies in a drug overdose.  Their kids want nothing to do with them.\n\nYou want to tell me those people know the way?!\n\nJesus might be simple - but I tell you He works.  If you are looking for direction you’ll find it in Jesus.\n\nAnother thing people are looking for is truth.  People want to know what is up and what is down.  People are looking for the truth.  They want something solid they can believe in and hold onto.\n\nAnd to them Jesus says “I am the truth.”  “I am truth personified.”  \n\nIf you want to learn how the world works, who better to learn from than the man that made it?  Jesus is the truth.  \n\nIf you follow Jesus, your eyes will be opened in ways you didn’t see before.  You’ll be able to understand things on a totally different level than the rest of the world.  the Bible will be plain to you.  He is the Truth.\n\nWe live in this world that is always changing.  Most people today are lamenting the fact that so many of our manufacturing jobs have gone over to other countries but what they don’t realize is that that is yesterdays news, right now a huge amount of white collar jobs are being outsourced to other countries.  It’s all changing so fast.\n\nBut Jesus never changes.  He is the rock, His word is perfect.  He is the same yesterday today and forever.  He is the beginning and the end.  He isn’t going anywhere and He isn’t changing.  Following Him will give you certainty in an uncertain world and truth in a world where it is hard to find.\n\nAnd lastly, people are looking for life.  They want to really live.  And to them Jesus says “I am the life.”\n\nthe Bible teaches us that we are dead in our trespasses and sins.  If you’ve never been saved you are literally the walking dead.  Spiritually, you are dead.  You have no spiritual life.  But when you trust Christ you get eternal life.  \n\nAnd the closer you get to Jesus, the more His life shines through you.\n\nYou know, I look around at the lost world sometimes and I think “That’s not living.”  Living for a paycheck - that’s not living.  Living for the next drink or the next fix - that’s not living.  Living for relationships that will never truly satisfy you - that’s not living.  \n\nBut in Jesus we have life.  Eternal life. Everlasting life.  Overflowling life.  More abundant life.\n\nCan I speak to you Christians for just a minute?  Make sure your life has some life in it.  Don’t use your Christianity as an excuse to be a boring fudy-dud.    Thomas Paine, a famous anti-Christian writer from the 1700s who grew up Quaker but turned his back on God said this:\n\n> If the God of the quakers had created the world, there would be no color or flowers in it.\n\nI hope people can’t say that about you and me.  I hope your life has some life in it because that is what God intends.  More abundant life.  Life flowing over.  Have fun.  Smile.  Enjoy the many blessings God has given to you.  There is nothing spiritual about being a boring colorless person with a frown on your face all the time.  Jesus has given you life so live.\n\nSo to get back to the message - Jesus is telling us that so many things we are looking for can be found in Him.  Life, Direction, Truth.  All can be found in Jesus because He is the way the truth and the life.\n\nSo that’s the first point.  And you might be saying to yourself “Pastor, that doesn’t sound so controversial.  That sounds kind of good.”\n\nWell, this second point is the part of this that people hate…\n\n# Jesus is the ONLY way to get what people are looking for.\nIn other words, the key statement of this verse is a statement of **exclusivity.** Jesus is saying that it is “my way or the highway.”  He is saying what our world hates the most - that his way is better than any other.\n\nOur culture is dominated by two “isms”: multiculturalism and postmodernism.\n\nMulticulturalism is all about the idea that all cultures are equal.  The multi-culturalists have trained us that our culture isn’t any better than the culture of…say…the Indians. It’s just different.  Both are equally good and valuable.  You can’t go around saying that our way is right.  That’s taboo. That’s bad.\n\nPostmodernism is all about the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth.  The post-modernists on the college campus say that you can’t really know anything for sure.  You can’t have big T truth.  Just your truth and my truth.  What’s true for me isn’t true for you and vice versa.  What matters is you.\n\nAnd that is it in a nutshell.  That’s the spirit of our age: it is radical self truth.  What matters is that you go your own way, be your own truth, live your own life.  That’s why we have men saying they are women and people denying the way that God made them.  That’s why you have these crazy people who are grown men who think they are actually a six year old girl stuck in a 40 year old man’s body.  Or grown ups that believe they are actually cats and dogs stuck in human bodies.  This craziness is just the natural logical outgrow of the spirit of our age which is “Be whatever you want.  Whatever you say is right.  Who am I to judge.”\n\nAnd into this mess comes Jesus.  And Jesus says none of that stuff is going to satisfy you.  There is no direction in it.  There is no truth in it.  There is no certainty in it.  It’s like building your house on the sand.  That is no way to live and living that way will result in eternal death.  And then He says I am “The way” “The truth” “The life” and “No Man cometh to the father but by me.”  In other words this statement completely goes against the spirit of our age.\n\nMan says...\n\n> There are many ways to God\n\nJesus says \n\n> I am THE way\n\nMan says\n\n> All religions are good.\n\nJesus says\n\n> I am the way the truth and the life no man commeth to the father but by me\n\nMan says \n\n> Your truth is as good as my truth\n\nJesus says\n\n> I am the way the truth and the life\n\nMan says \n\n> You can go your own way and make your own path\n\nJesus says \n\n> I am THE way.  There is no other.\n\nThe world is perfectly happy with us saying that Jesus is “a” way, but they don’t want to be told that he is “the” way.  They are perfectly happy with us saying he is “a truth” but they hate that he is “the truth.”  We can say “He is a life” but they don’t want to hear that he is “the life.”\n\nAnd yet this is is what God calls on us to believe: there is no other way.  \n\nThat means that if you are on some other road than the Jesus road you are on the **wrong road** and you are headed to destruction.  That means if you are chasing some other truth than the Jesus truth you have **no truth** at all.  That means if you are living a life other than the Jesus life its the **wrong life**.\n\nListen folks, God doesn’t want you to take your Jesus vitamins along with your other pursuits - He wants Jesus to be your way.  He doesn’t just want to inject you with a little bit of Jesus in the morning along with everything else - He want’s Jesus to be your truth.  He doesn’t just want you to have a little taste of Jesus on Sundays - He wants Jesus to be your life.  \n\nIn other words: He’s not the salt and pepper - He’s the whole meal.\n\nColossians 3:4 says this:\n\n> *”When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.”*\n\n“Christ who is our life.”  Think about that.\n\nGalatians 2:20 puts it this way:\n\n> *”20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.”*\n\nWe are supposed to be living the Christ life.  The whole thing is supposed to be about Jesus.\n\n# Conclusion\nListen folks, let me close this up by making three quick points of application (five minutes tops):\n\nThe first one is this...\n\n##  The Christ life is the best life to live.\n\nThe life of simply following Jesus as our way, trusting Jesus as our Truth and letting Jesus live through us is a blessed life.  It is a life that gives clarity in times of confusion, peace in times of storm, comfort in times of pain.  It gives you eternal purpose.  \n\nSo if you are not doing it yet - follow Jesus.  Just go where He is leading you.  Be where He is.\n\nAs 1 John 5:12 says...\n\n> *”12 He that hath the Son hath life; [and] he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.”*\n\nSo follow Jesus.  \n\nA second quick point from this verse is this...\n\n## Christ wants more than your leftovers, He wants you whole life.\nRomans 12:1 says:\n\n> *”Romans 12:1 (KJV) 1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.”*\n\nThe Christ-life thing is a whole life thing.  He wants all of you.  He wants you to live as a human sacrifice.\n\nA lot of people say “well I’ve tried the whole Christian thing and it didn’t work for me.”  Maybe you are secretly saying that.  But if all Christianity is to you is a once a week exercise that you don’t think about the rest of the week - that’s not what Jesus was talking about.  He wants to be your way your truth and your life.\n\nOne more takeaway from this passage:\n\n## We must be willing to embrace the exclusivity of Jesus and the shame and reproach that comes with it.\n\nWe have to be willing to say what Jesus said here “That He is the only way.”  That “no man cometh to the Father but by Him.”\n\nListen, that means that I can’t say to my Hindu friend Chirag, who I talk with every day, that his Hinduism is ok.   That they are both paths to God.  Because the Bible teaches that “no man cometh to the father but by me.”  That means that it is not enough to be a moral atheist.  \n\nWe have to be willing to say that Jesus is the only way.\n\nWe have the cure and His name is Jesus.  The world may hate that message.  But it’s still the only message that works.",

Let’s give the word of God the respect it deserves:\n\n”Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ. And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.”\n\n”But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people. And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also; Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus. And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.”\n\n”And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews. These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so. Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few. But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people. And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still. And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.”\n\nI’m going to start out this morning by confessing something to you: I hate going to walmart. Sorry Steve. Sorry Connie. But I do. Let me tell you why I hate going to Walmart - because every time I go there I see a snapshot of society. Grown people walking around in pajama pants and ripped up T-shirts at 5pm. You know - it bothers me.\n\nOur world and our town is spiraling out of control and it seems like it is going down hill fast and what do people want to do? Buy more Pokemon cards - read another celebrity gossip mag. It bothers me.\n\nI want to make a difference. I want to make the world a better place. I want to add value.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes I heard a preacher say in college is:\n\nIf you want to make a difference you have to be different, nothing is made better by adding more of the same.\n\nI want to make a difference.\n\nIn our text this morning, in verse 6, there is an amazing statement. Enemies of Paul and his team said this about them:\n\n”These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also.”\n\nAt this point, Paul and Silas have been in Macedonia for only a short period of time. Maybe a couple of months. They have been in this city for a very short period of time. Yet this is the reputation they already had “They turned the world upside down.”\n\nI wish people would say about the people of Bible Baptist “Those people - they are turning the world upside down.” They are making an impact. They are making a splash.\n\nCan I be honest? Our church could cease to exist and very few people outside of our church family would even notice. Some missionaries might miss a support check. Some people may have to find another place to play basketball on Monday night. But beyond that??? We aren’t turning the world upside down.\n\nBut we ought to. Let me tell you something - our church could have a noticeable impact on our city. So much so that people would say “I’ve never been to that Bible Baptist place and I may never go, but I’m glad they are here.” Lives are changed at that church. That church is turning out good young people who are making a difference in our town and in our country. In our little world - they could say “those people are turning the world upside down.”\n\nAnd do you know what - there ought to be some people who are a little mad about it. The drug dealers. The bar owners. I wish they were mad at us.\n\nDo you realize that there have been times in history where God’s done a work in a town and all the bars shut down? Do you realize there have been moments in history where the entire course of a town and even of a country is changed by the gospel - by a church.\n\nListen to me church - what our country needs isn’t Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or any other politician - what our country needs is a revival. It needs Jesus Christ. It needs Christians who are going to turn the world upside down.\n\nSo, I think it would help us if we look at this text and ask “What exactly were Paul and his team doing that was turning the world upside down?” Is there a patter here? How could we do it?\n\nRight, so, I’m going to give you five things I see Paul doing in this passage that turned the world upside down. Let’s pray and we’ll jump right in.\n\nIf you are going to turn the world upside down:\n\nWhat are going to do? Let’s look at what Paul did here and find out. First,\n\n1. You have to follow God’s script. (1-2)\nNotice what Paul does as he comes into this new city - Thessalonica. It says in verses 1-2 that there was a synagogue there, so Paul ”as his manner was” went in unto them and preached to them.\n\nNow, we’ve been looking at Acts for awhile now, and over and over we’ve seen Paul do this. He goes to a new city. He finds the local synagogue and he preaches there. And Every. Single. Time. Every single time - the result has been the same: He’s caused some kind of a riot and people have tried to hurt him.\n\nEvery single time.\n\nYet, what does Paul do - he keeps doing it. He keeps going back to the synagogue. Even in this story - he goes to the Synagogue in Thessalonica - bam. Riot. He runs to the next city, Berea and where does he go? The synagogue.\n\nNow, why is he doing this? Is he stupid? Is he dense? No. He’s doing it because that was God’s will for him.\n\nIn Romans 1:16 Paul said:\n\n”For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.”\n\nIn Romans 2:9 Paul said:\n\n”Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;”\n\nPaul was following the plan of God for Him. God told Paul “I want you to be a witness - go to the jews first, and then go to the Gentiles.” So for Paul, it didn’t matter that he constantly ran into opposition - to do anything else was to disobey God.\n\nSo here is the first lesson in turning the world upside down - obey God’s will. You aren’t going to have any positive impact on the world unless you are following God’s script.\n\n1 John 2:17 says:\n\n”And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”\n\nIf you want to make a real impact on the world - get in on God’s program because it’s the only thing that is going to last forever. It may not make sense to the world - in fact, you can write it down, it won’t - but God’s will and God’s will alone is what is going to stand for eternity.\n\nThe second thing we learn about how to turn the world upside down is:\n\n2. You have to preach God’s message. (3-4)\nLook at verses 2-3. Notice what it says:\n\n”and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures, Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.”\n\nIt wasn’t Paul’s magnetism that was turning the world upside down, it was his message and it wasn’t because Paul was just a good speaker and a good writer, it’s because His message came from God.\n\nNotice two things about Paul’s message:\n\nHe preached the savior.\nIf you were going to preach a message to a jewish audience, what would they need to hear? They would need to hear that the messiah was going to have to suffer and rise again, and that Jesus was that Messiah.\n\nThe content of Paul’s message was a character - it was Jesus.\n\nIf we are going to preach a message that is going to turn the world upside down, it’s going to have to be the message of Jesus Christ.\n\nListen:\n\npolitics isn’t going to save people.\nphilosophy isn’t going to save people.\nPeople don’t need to hear how to clean their life up.\nPeople don’t need a bunch of morality.\nPeople don’t need 7 steps to a new you.\nPeople NEED JESUS!\nThey need to know that God sent His son who lived the perfect life they can’t live and took their punishment on the cross and that He rose again and that He’s coming again. They need to know that if they just “believe on the Lord Jesus Christ” they can be saved and have a relationship with Him.\n\nIt’s all about Christ.\n\nNotice a second thing about the message that turned the world upside down:\n\nHe preached scripture.\nVerse 2 says “He reasoned with them out of the scripture.” The world isn’t going to be moved by “thus saith Ryan Hayden” They don’t need to hear the New York Times or Reader’s Digest. They need to hear Thus Saith the Lord. They need the word of God.\n\nMy words have no authority. His words are the law. My words are at best speculation. His words are revelation. My words are temporary. His Word is forever. My words have little power. His words is the hammer that breaks the rock in pieces and the two-edged sword that can divide the joints and the marrow.\n\nIf we are going to turn the world upside down - let’s do it with scripture.\n\nSo they followed God’s script and they spoke God’s message.\n\nA third thing we have to know if we are going to turn the world upside down is...\n\n3. You have to expect Satan’s pushback. (5-9)\nIn verses 5-9 some interesting things happen: Some people get saved. That’s great. But some people get jealous too. And the jealous people try to get Paul and his team, but they can’t find them, so they find the guy in town they are staying with - Jason - and they drag him before the a mob.\n\nIt’s bad. Like riot bad. It’s so bad, that the Christians in Thessalonica say to Paul and his team “you guys have to get out of here” and so Paul flees the city. Probably not so much for his own safety, but for the safety of the other Christians there.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time on this point - but you have to understand that if you are going to make a difference for God - you are going to have enemies.\n\nWinston Churchill said:\n\nYou have enemies? Good. That means you’ve stood up for something, sometime in your life.\n\nElbert Hubbard said:\n\nTo escape criticism—do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.\n\nSo this is true in general. This is true for everything. You can’t make any kind of change without making enemies.\n\nBut for us it goes further - because we aren’t fighting flesh and blood we are in a battle against Satan and all his forces and if we are going to advance the will of God - you have to know the devil’s crew is going to push back.\n\nSo we should expect that and serve God anyway.\n\nA fourth thing we learn from this story about turning the world upside down is:\n\n4. You have to determine to keep going. (10-15)\nIn verses 10-15, Paul and Silas have fled Thessalonica. So what do they do? They go right to the next city Berea, and where do they go? The synagogue.\n\nThey just kept on going. They’d leave Berea and go on to another place. Over and over again. Just plodding in the Lord’s will.\n\nSome people quit at the first sign of adversity. They aren’t the people who turn the world upside down for God. You have to keep going. Proverbs says “A just man falleth seven times then riseth again.” You’ve got to get up and keep serving God.\n\nOne quick side note and then we’ll continue:\n\nSo Paul goes to Berea and it says that the people there are more noble because they don’t just take Paul’s word for it - they search the scripture.\n\nPlease, please - study the Bible for yourself. Don’t just take the things that I say at face value. I can’t tell you how often I hear people say things that are totally unbiblical but they think its gospel truth because some preacher said it somewhere. Study the Bible.\n\nListen, if the apostle Paul needed to be fact checked, I mean he was a guy writing parts of the Bible, then it’s a healthy practice for you too.\n\nOne more thing we can learn about being a person who turns the world upside down. Turn to the book of 1 Thessalonians. Remember, Paul is in Thessalonica in this story. This book is a book written to the people from this story. Look what Paul says in verse 9:\n\n”For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;”\n\nIf we are going to turn the world upside down there is one last thing we have to have total faith in, and that is...\n\n5. You have to realize God is working. (1 Thessalonians 1:9)\nYou see, when Paul left Thessalonica. When he had to flee. The outlook didn’t look so hot. But do you know, that Thessalonica turned into one of his favorite churches. What happened there might have looked like a train wreck - like a tragedy - but God was working.\n\nSo here is the lesson for us this morning: find out what God wants you to do and just keep doing it. Keep sharing the gospel. Keep serving God. There will be blowback - count on it. There will be trials. But if you are faithful and just keep going and serving by God’s grace - you’ll see God do some amazing things and as much as anyone can you’ll turn the world upside down.\n\nLet’s stand for invitation and prayer.",

    "body": "# Psalm 82 - Leaders Need To Remember\n\n## Introduction\nThere is this term you hear from time to time nowadays: “Social Justice Warrior.”  If you are on Facebook or you watch Fox News, you’ll hear it.  It’s usually used as a term of derision.  It’s usually used as a smear.  It’s a mocking term for a certain kind of leftist.  \n\nAnd by the way, the people who are called Social Justice Warriors or SJWs—at least many of them—are very dangerous people. Many of them are Marxists.  Many of them push identity politics.  Many of them are revolutionaries.  Most of them want biblical Christianity to be eradicated and view us as the enemy, so I think it’s right to be wary of SJWs or or Social Justice Warriors.  It’s a real thing, and they are really dangerous.\n\nBut what about the term “social justice?”  Obviously, these crazy leftists love this term and this idea: Social justice.  Does that mean it’s bad? \n\nIt certainly can be bad.  If social justice means Marxism, then it’s bad.  If social justice means identity politics, then it’s bad.  It’s a term with a lot of baggage because it’s misused.\n\nBut one thing I want you to understand is that social justice is a biblical idea.  It’s an abused idea.  It’s an misunderstood idea, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t biblical.  Just because a bunch of crazy leftists use the term doesn’t mean we should throw the whole idea out and ignore it.\n\nBiblical social justice simply means that everyone has a fair shot and gets a fair deal.  It means that powerful people don’t abuse poorer people.  It means that society takes care of the needs of the poor and destitute and tries to give them equal opportunity and equal hearing under the law.\n\nLet me give you some examples:\n\n* There have been times in our country’s history where millions of people were enslaved based on race and treated like they were less than human. That really happened.\n* There have been times in our country’s history where we herded up Indians from their land and shipped them to the parts of the country we didn’t want and then didn’t keep our promises to them.  That really happened.\n* There have been times in our country’s history where workers, usually first- or second-generation immigrant workers from Europe, were exploited and worked for fourteen hours a day in terrible conditions for almost no pay.  That really happened.\n* There have been times in our country’s history where we drafted people for war and did it in such a way that poor people and non-white people made up almost all of the draftees, and rich people got an out.  That really happened.\n\nThose are cases of social injustice.  Now, let me ask you two questions, and we’ll get into our text.  Don’t answer out loud; just think about it.\n\n* First, do you think God cares about this social injustice in society?\n* Second, do you think believers should care about social injustice in society?\n\nTurn to Psalm 82 if you aren’t there already. Let’s read this Psalm together.  It’s just eight verses:\n\n> *”1 [A Psalm of Asaph.] God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. 2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. 4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. 5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. 6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. 7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. 8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.”*  (Psa 82:1-8 KJV)\n\n\nNow I don’t want to talk about social justice.  Frankly, it’s not a popular subject with our crowd.  It’s the kind of subject that makes people whisper, “Pastor’s some kind of closet liberal or something.”\n\nAnother reason I don’t want to talk about it is because in liberal churches, it’s talked about too much.  Over vacation, I was talking to my uncle and his family, who recently switched churches.  They were in a fairly conservative evangelical church, and the pastor started doing some fishy things, so they literally got in their car and joined the next church down the road, which was a United Methodist church.  \n\nUncle Kenny was telling me that he hates this church because the pastor—a lady—only ever talks about social justice and leftist politics.  Many times in our conversation I said, “Why don’t you find a better church then?” And he said, “Because the people in this church are very conservative salt-of-the-earth people,” and he doesn’t want to abandon them. So you understand that there are a lot of churches and a lot of groups where all they want to talk about is social justice. I don’t want to have anything to do with that, and I don’t want anyone to ever accuse our church of that kind of thing.\n\nBut I’m also a biblical preacher.  More than anything as a pastor, I’m committed to preaching what the Bible says, even if it isn’t popular with you.  And this is a chapter—one of many in the Old Testament—with a theme of social justice.  The theme of this chapter is looking out for the poor, needy, downtrodden, and abused.\n\nLook at the first two verses:\n\n> *”God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. How long will you judge unjustly?”*\n\nWhat does this mean?  We have to get this right or we won’t get anything right.\n\nObviously, we don’t believe in “little g” gods, so this verse cannot literally be talking about false gods like Zeus, Apollo, Diana, or Baal.  The word “gods” here is a term that is sometimes used in the Old Testament to refer to judges and leaders.\n\nFor example, in Exodus 22, there are several times when it says, “Bring them before the judges,” and the word “judges” is the same word translated as “gods” here.  In Exodus 22:28, it even says *”Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.”* Yet many times in the same part of scripture, it says that if you find idols or idol worshippers, then they should be utterly destroyed.\n\nSo the word “gods” here is not referring to false gods. It’s referring to judges or leaders.\n\nSo this is a psalm for judges and leaders.  If you are in a position of power, then this is a psalm for you.\n\nSpecifically, the Psalm tells judges and leaders to remember six things:\n\n## 1. Remember God is watching (vv. 1)\n## 2. Remember to reject wickedness (vv. 2)\n## 3. Remember to justly care for the poor and destitute (vv. 3-4)\n* You should defend them.\n* You should do justice to them.\n* You should deliver them.\n## 4. Remember that this won’t be popular (vv. 5)\n## 5. Remember that no matter how powerful you are, you will die and meet your maker (vv. 6)\n## 6. Remember that God is going to make everything just and fair one day. (vv. 7)",

    "body": "# Mark 4:1-20\nI do not have a green thumb; not even close.  The closest I’ve come or ever even wanted to come to having a garden was growing some cooking herbs out behind my house.  Cooking herbs are basically weeds. You don’t have to water them. They grow just about anywhere.  I managed to mess up even that.\n\nBut this year, Brother Harold decided that my kids needed a vegetable garden.  Diane Roberts was a co-conspirator, so Audrey, Molly, and Noah have become little tomato, cucumber, and pepper farmers, and they are doing TOO well at it.  I’ve never seen so many little tomatoes or weird-looking little cucumbers.\n\nWe have this one tomato plant that seems like it’s given us a million little tomatoes.  Just about every day, Audrey goes back there and fills up several bags of these little things.  It’s insane.  They aren’t regular tomatoes. They are these yellow and brown tomatoes called heirloom tomatoes.  We’ve got tons of them.\n\nBut here is the thing: That tomato plant started as a tiny little seed, almost so small you cannot even see it.  And here is the second thing: That tomato plant isn’t just producing a bunch of tomatoes.  It’s producing a bunch of tiny little seeds—hundreds of them—that could each produce its own tomato plant, which could in turn produce hundreds more tomatoes or tiny little seeds.  Under ideal conditions, little yellow tomatoes would take over the world. This is what keeps me up at night.\n\nSeeds are amazing and powerful things, but seeds have to be planted in a good place.  We put those plants in Miracle Grow, in raised buckets so the animals couldn’t get to them, with air holes, and next to the chain link fence so they could be supported as they grow.\n\nIf we took those seeds and put then on the sidewalk or the kitchen counter, nothing would happen.  If we took those seeds and put them on the snowy ground in Antarctica, nothing would happen.  If we took those seeds and cast them into the Atlantic Ocean, nothing would happen.  \n\nIn Mark 4:1-20, Jesus gives the first of many parables.  This one is usually called “The Parable of the Seeds,” but it should be called “The Parable of the Soils,” because the seed doesn’t change in this story; just the soil changes.\n\nThe word “parable” means “to cast alongside.”  Parables were put alongside teaching to help us to understand it.  A parable is a kind of metaphor.  It’s a story or word picture that helps us understand a heavenly truth.\n\nBut parables can also hide the truth at the same time.  If you don’t have the keys—if you don’t understand what each thing stands for—then a parable is just going to leave you scratching your head. \n\nSo parables allowed Jesus to teach one group—the group that wanted to hear and understand—while simultaneously confusing another—the group that just wanted to catch Jesus in His words.\n\nLet’s go ahead and read Mark 4:1-20 this morning.\n\n> *”1 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land. 2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in his doctrine, 3 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow: 4 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up. 5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: 6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. 8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some an hundred. 9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. 10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable. 11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all [these] things are done in parables: 12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and [their] sins should be forgiven them. 13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then will ye know all parables? 14 The sower soweth the word. 15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts. 16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; 17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended. 18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, 19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful. 20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear the word, and receive [it], and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.”*\n\nHave you ever sat on a beach and listened to someone teaching from a boat?  I haven’t, but that is what Jesus had to do here.  He’s got a huge crowd listening to Him, and He uses a boat as a pulpit and the beach as an auditorium.  \n\nJesus probably looked around at this huge crowd and knew what we can’t know.  He knew their hearts.  \n\n* He could look at that guy over there and think, *“That guy is really getting it.  He really wants to follow me.  He’s going to be a great Christian someday.”*  \n* And He could look at that person and think, *“She is just here for the excitement.  As soon as the excitement goes away, she’ll forget this even happened.”*  \n* Jesus might look at the guy in the way back and think, *“He doesn’t even want to be here. His wife made him come.”*\n\nSo that is what Jesus’ parable was about.  It was about the types of people who receive Christ’s teaching.\n\nReally, it was about how to be a fruitful and productive Christian.  The word of God is powerful.  The word of God is like a little seed that, if it’s allowed to grow and do its thing, can really, really make a huge difference in the world:\n\n* The word of God can produce eternal salvation. I Peter 1:23 says, *”Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.”*\n* The word of God can break up our hard hearts. Jeremiah 23:29 says, *”Is not my word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?”*\n* The word of God can build you up and give you an inheritance. Acts 20:23 says, *”And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.”*\n* The word of God can cause you to be *like a tree planted by the rivers of water, whose leave also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper”* as Psalm 1 says.\n\n(I could literally spend the next twenty minutes doing this.)  \n\n* The word of God guides us and keeps us out of trouble: *Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.*  (Psalm 119:105)\n* The word of God feeds us: *”man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord”* (Deuteronomy 8:3)\n* The word of God delights us: *”More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.”* (Psalm 119:10)\n* The word of God keeps us from sin: *”Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.”* (Psalm 119:11)\n* The word of God enables us for ministry and makes us complete Christians: *”That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.”* (2 Timothy 3:17)\n\nSo the word of God is powerful.  The word of God is amazing, but for the word of God—this amazing seed—to be fruitful, it has to be planted in the right kind of heart—the right kind of soil.\n\nWe live in Central Illinois.  Our entire communities are built around good dirt.  That’s our main asset around here.  We don’t have the ocean; we don’t have mountains; we don’t have a lot of forests; we don’t have a lot of trees.  What we have is lots and lots and lots of good dirt.  We have land with some of the best soil in the world.  \n\nI’ve dug fence posts for a job in New Hampshire, which is called the Granite State.  That nickname wasn’t randomly generated.  You can’t dig but a few inches in New Hampshire before you hit lots and lots of rock.\n\nI’ve worked out in the fields in East Tennessee, and down there, they have this thick, hard red-orange clay they have to fight with.  \n\nBut here in Illinois we have some of the best dirt in the world.  That’s why driving down the interstate feels like driving through one neverending corn and soy farm.\n\nSoil is important, and having the right kind of heart is important if you want to receive God’s word and be a fruitful Christian.\n\nSo Jesus gives us this parable about three kinds of hearts—three kinds of soils that don’t receive the word and become fruitful.  **As we look at these this morning, ask yourself if you have one of these kinds of hearts.**\n\nThe first bad soil is \n\n## 1. The Wayside. \n\nThis is the hard heart.\n\nIn Jesus’ day, the farms weren’t perfectly square acres like we have now. They were twisty serpentine patches, and around these little farm patches would be paths where farmers would walk and where oxen and horses would trod.  \n\nThe word “wayside” here is just road.  In fact, this same word is translated as “highway” several times in the New Testament.  \n\nWhat were roads before we had concrete and blacktop?  They were just paths that had been walked on over and over and over again until they were rock hard and nothing grew there.\n\nSo the wayside represents a hard heart.  \n\nYou throw a seed on the road, and it’s just going to sit there.  It’s never going into the road.  It’s just going to sit on the hard surface of the road until some bird sees it and snatches it up.  \n\nJesus was saying that some people’s hearts are so hard that when they hear the word, it has no chance.  It never penetrates.  Satan just comes and snatches it away.\n\nMaybe they say, “That’s ridiculous.  I know science.  This is 2018.  Enough with this Bible nonsense.”   \n\nMaybe they are just so busy that the word never has a chance to penetrate.  They just don’t have the time to stop and think.  They don’t have the mental bandwidth.\n\nMaybe something happened to them in the past and they are bitter about it and mad at God.\n\nBut they are hard-hearted, so the word has little chance.  It just bounces off like a bb shot at an elephant side, because they have put up a shell.  \n\nSo that’s the first type: The wayside, the hard-hearted person.  The second kind of bad soil Jesus described is…\n\n## 2. The Stony Ground\n\nThis is the shallow heart.  \n\nIn Palestine, this stony ground would be soil that looks normal on the top, but just a few inches below the surface, there is a large piece of limestone, like a shelf, so there is no room for roots to take hold and grow.\n\nJesus said:\n\n> *”And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth: But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.”*\n\nA shallow heart doesn’t reject the word.  A shallow heart enthusiastically receives the word.  I mean, they seem like they are on fire.  They seem like they are just going like gangbusters.  They are riding high.\n\nBut then something happens, and they are gone. You don’t see them anymore.  Pretty soon, you are talking after church and saying, “Hey, whatever happened to so-and-so? They seemed like they were doing so good.”\n\nThey get saved, and it’s exciting.  They go to the revival service, and it’s exciting. They are just doing so well, but then the excitement wears off.  You get back to the boring.  The special speaker goes out of town, and you have to listen to me week in and week out.  And poof! They disappear.\n\nI can think of some people like that here. I mean it’s exciting for a couple weeks but then they are harder to find than common sense in Washington D.C..\n\nSpurgeon said it this way:\n\n> Then there are many more, whose religion must be sustained by enthusiastic surroundings.  They seem to have been baptized in boiling water; and unless the temperature around them is kept up to that point, they wither away… the religion that is born of mere excitement will die when the excitement is over.”\n\nGrowth isn’t always exciting.  In fact, most growth is boring.  Most growth is day by day.  A whole lot of growth is below the surface.  A whole lot of growth is just a little bit at a time, so little you can’t even see it.\n\nWe don’t look at our kids every day and think “wow, they are growing” but every time we see grandma, which may only be once every six months, it’s obvious to her.\n\nJesus said this about the stony ground:\n\n> *”And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness; And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time: afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake, immediately they are offended.”*\n\nSo they grow quickly, but the minute it gets hard, they are gone.  The minute it gets unpopular, they are gone.  When people start making fun of them, poof! They are gone.\n\nBecause they are shallow ground.  It never takes root. It’s all surface.  It’s all emotion.  \n\nSo you have the wayside, you have the stony ground, and then you have the third kind of bad soil…\n\n## 3. The Thorny Ground\n\nVerse seven says: \n\n> *”And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.”*\n\nIf the wayside is the hard heart, and the stony ground is the shallow heart, then this represents the crowded heart. \n\nJesus described the crowded heart people this way:\n\n> *”And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the word, And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.”*\n\nWhen I was a kid, there was one chore I hated more than any other chore.  I hated weeding the garden.  I would do ANYTHING before I had to weed the garden.  It always seemed to be my job, too.\n\nNo.  Seriously.  I’m having PTSD right now remembering this little patch of garden we had next to the road, and my parents would make me scoot along the road with a screwdriver and dig out these weeds that would grow there.\n\nWhen I imagine the gulags in Siberia, I imagine a bunch of people being forced to pull weeds.  I hate that job.\n\nApparently, there were some lazy Jews who hated weeding the fields, too, because some of them would just burn off their thorns and weeds, or cut off their thorns and weeds so the field looked good to go. But of course, the roots were still down there, so the plants would grow, but the weeds would grow, too.  And they would have to compete for sunshine and for water, and the weeds would inevitably win.\n\nThis last kind of bad soil is probably the most common.   Every Sunday I look around and I think, “What’s going to win today: The word of God, or the mortgage payment?  The word or the vacation plans? The word or the promotion you are working on?”\n\nMaybe you respond to the invitation, and you determine you are going to start reading your Bible faithfully again and coming to church faithfully again. Immediately after that, some little crisis happens, and it’s out the window.  You don’t mean to do it, but life just takes over.\n\nYou can’t be a fruitful Christian if everything else is crowding your life.  \n\nSo three types of bad soil: The wayside—the hard heart; the stony ground—the shallow heart; the thorny ground—the crowded heart.\n\nWhat do we do with this passage?  How do we apply it to our life?\n\nHere is my challenge to you this morning.  Don’t look at this deterministically.  I don’t think Jesus’ intention here was for us to say, “Oh well, I have a crowded heart.  Oh well, I have a stony heart.  Oh well, I have a hard heart. I guess I’ll never be a fruitful Christian.  What’s the point?”\n\nI don’t think that is the way we should look at it at all.  \n\nHere is the thing:  **Hard soil can be plowed up**.   It can be broken up.  You can take a tamping rod to it; you can take a cultivator to it.  You can make it good soil.\n\nFor some of you hard-hearted people out there, God might have to bring some real hardship in your life to stir you up so you can receive the word.  Maybe you ought to do some cultivating.\n\n**Shallow soil can be made deeper.**  You can always add topsoil, or you can dig down and break the rocks below.  If you have a shallow Christianity this morning, why don’t you determine to dig deep? Become a regular.  Embrace the slow deep growth you need to be a fruitful Christian.\n\n**Thorny and weedy soil can be weeded.** You can guard your heart and your life so that you aren’t living for riches and the cares of this world.  You can push those things aside and determine that God’s word will be the priority.\n\nWeeding isn’t fun. I hate weeding, but it isn’t hard.  It can be done.  We can pull out the weeds of the cares of this world from our hearts so the Word of God can do its work in us.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with the seed.  God’s word is unbelievably powerful and unbelievably fruitful.  How’s the soil?",

    "body": "# Mark 5:1-20\nLet’s get started this morning by jumping right into our text and reading Mark 5:1-20.  It’s a bit long, so try to follow along:\n\n> *”1 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. 2 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 3 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: 4 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. 5 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 6 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 7 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 8 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 9 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 11 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 12 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 13 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. 14 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. 15 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 16 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine. 17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts. 18 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him. 19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. 20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.”*  (Mar 5:1-20 KJV)\n\nWe just got back from vacation.  It was a good vacation.  We went to see my brother Jay get married down in Knoxville.  She went through with it.  It was a great wedding.  Then we spent almost a week in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg.  We did the aquarium.  We did Dollywood.  We drove around the Smokies.  We slept in.  It was a great vacation.\n\nI’m a big believer in vacation.  I think you should try to get away with your family at least once a year.  In the Old Testament, there were several feasts and periods where the Jews would travel as a family to Jerusalem, and I’ve always thought that one of the reasons God included those feasts was because people need to get away. People need that down time.\n\nFor the last couple of weeks in the book of Mark, Jesus has been absolutely overrun with work.  There are thousands of people literally pressing for His attention.  It’s gotten so bad that He can’t preach on land anymore. He has to preach from a boat so people can’t get to Him.  He can’t publish His itinerary anymore because people will overrun Him.  He’s not even had time to eat.  From a human perspective, Jesus needed a vacation.\n\nAnd so He told the disciples to pass over to the other side of the sea of Galilee.  Two weeks ago, we looked at what happened on that journey.  Remember that Jesus was sleeping through the crazy storm and told the winds and waves, “Peace, be still.”   But I didn’t talk much about where they were going.\n\nJesus left Capernaum, in the northwest corner of the Sea of Galilee, and traveled all the way across the lake, about fifteen miles, to the country of the Gadarenes. Now the only thing that is significant about this is that Capernaum is firmly in the Jewish part of Galilee, but this area is very much a Gentile area.  It was completely controlled by the Romans.  Even though it’s just on the other side of a lake, it’s really another country and another culture altogether.\n\nA couple of years ago, we traveled to Canada for my other brother’s wedding, and we stayed the first night in the city of Windsor, Ontario.  Here is the thing about Windsor, Ontario: It’s literally right across the river from Detroit.  In fact, from our hotel room, we see clear as day into the GM Building. It was maybe a quarter of a mile away across the river, but the culture, the restaurants, the accent, and the television were all completely different.  It’s a weird feeling.\n\nMaybe the human plan was for Jesus to get some rest in a place where people wouldn’t know Him.  At least that’s probably what the disciples were thinking, but that’s not what happened.\n\nJesus gets off the boat, and they are immediately met by this madman.  The Bible says he lived in the tombs.  This guy literally lives in a crypt full of corpses.  He’s a danger to society. People are trying to chain him up, but because he possesses some superhuman strength, he can’t be bound.  He just breaks the chains like Superman.  The people in the area hear him from time to time crying out loudly like some kind of wild animal.   He’s cutting himself and trying to hurt himself.\n\nHe’s a crazy, scary, wild, untamable dude.\n\nWhenever I read this story, I think of a guy down in Dalton I met while I was visiting in the jail down there.  This guy had long, grisly, stringy hair and was just nuts.  He was so nuts that he was always in solitary.  He’d write on the walls using his own waste.  He’d run around naked.  He’d scream, holler, and say crazy stuff.  He was cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, and it was scary.\n\nOne time at the hospital, they had me visit in the psych ward.  Behavioral health, they call it.  I went in there, and it was just creepy.  I really believe I was talking to demon-possessed people in there.  It was very, very creepy.\n\nThis is what Jesus is dealing with here, but it’s much, much worse.  The man runs to Jesus and immediately screams out:\n\n> *”What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.”* \n\nJesus has a conversation with Him, and we learn that the man is possessed by devils.  In fact, he’s possessed by a legion of devils.  A Roman legion had 6,000 foot soldiers, plus calvary and support staff.  This guy likely has thousands of demons possessing him.\n\nAnd Jesus commands them to go out and allows them to enter into some pigs, and they immediately cause the pigs to run off of a cliff to their death.\n\nBut this crazy man isn’t crazy anymore.  He’s met Jesus, and he is sitting, clothed, and in His right mind.  Jesus changed Him.  Jesus healed Him.\n\nNow, there are three things I think this story teaches us about: It teaches us about Satan, it teaches us about the Savior, and it teaches us about Salvation.  Those are going to be my three main points this morning.\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll jump right into that outline.**\n\nThe first thing this story teaches us about is…\n\n## About Satan:\n\nThis is probably the best known story about demonic and satanic activity in the whole Bible, and it can teach us a thing or two about Satan.\n\nFirst, it teaches us that…\n\n* Satan has help. \n\nThis man was possessed by demons—thousands of demons.  \n\nI know we modern people don’t talk about this spiritual stuff very often.  I know there are a lot of preachers who want to skip over this stuff because it sounds very hocus pocus, very Dark Ages.   Believing in demons is about like believing that the world is flat.  It’s about like being in on the Salem Witch Trials.  We are far too modern and sophisticated for that.\n\nBut then you have the Bible, and if you believe the Bible is true, you cannot deny the existence of demons.   I believe that the Bible teaches us that Satan was an angel in heaven. He led a revolt there and took a third of the angels from heaven with him. Now they have free reign for the most part on the earth.\n\nEphesians 6:12 says:\n\n> *”For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”*\n\nThere is real spiritual wickedness out there.  There is a host of demons out there.  We talk about a real Satan—and that is scary enough—but he has lots and lots of help.\n\nA second thing we learn about Satan in this story is that…\n\n* Satan doesn’t keep his promises.\n\nSin and Satan always promise fun, prestige, and stuff.  The world is telling us over and over that it can make us happy and it can make us satisfied; thousands and thousands of empty promises.\n\nEvery billboard is a promise.  Every magazine ad or TV commercial is a promise.  Do this, drink this, buy this, and you will be happy. Most of our pop songs are a promise. They swear this lifestyle is where it’s at.  Red Solo Cups or Cheeseburgers in Paradise: Pick your poison. \n\nBut the world and Satan never show you the other side.  They show the well-dressed guy drinking Bacardi at the roulette table with beautiful women on both sides, but they never show you the homeless guy on skid row.  The world will show you the happy-go-lucky party people, but they’ll never show you the addiction, the STDs, or the pain it leaves in its wake.\n\nI don’t think this man woke up one day and thought, “I’m going to be that crazy, homeless, demon-possessed guy that scares everyone and cuts himself.”  I think the devil put out bait, and he bit it again and again.\n\nAnother thing this story teaches is…\n\n* Satan doesn’t care at all about you.\n\nDo you think this man was happy?  Do you think this man was fulfilled? He was enslaved.  He wasn’t crying out for joy; he was crying out from agony.  He was cutting himself.\n\nAgain, it’s expectation versus reality.  Satan promises you’ll be like a god, and you’ll know and be free.  He doesn’t show the pain; the loneliness; the struggle.  Eat the apple, and everything will be alright.  He doesn’t show the kids killing each other.\n\nSatan is extremely powerful and extremely wise, and he doesn’t care at all about you.  He will eat you up and spit you out in a heartbeat.\n\nWhich brings me to the last thing this story teaches about Satan…\n\n* Satan and all his forces are terrified by the power and presence of Jesus.\n\nThis man had a legion of demons—thousands and thousands of them—and those demons couldn’t withstand one word from Jesus.  They came to Jesus on their knees begging because the demons know where the power is.\n\nListen, folks: Demons are scary. You should be scared of the devil.  He walks about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.  That’s scary stuff.  You should be scared of demons.\n\nBut you also need to realize this: If you are under Jesus’ control, the demons can’t touch you.  The devil himself can’t touch you.  I believe people can be demon—possessed, but I don’t think Christians can be demon-possessed.\n\n> *”Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.”* (1 John 4:4)\n\nSo this story teaches us a lot about Satan, but I think it teaches us more…\n\n## About the Savior:\n\nSpecifically, there are two things I see about Jesus in this story that are very, very encouraging.\n\nThe first thing I learn about Jesus in this story is…\n\n* The Savior shows compassion when others show revulsion and terror.\n\nI think most people saw this man and ran away.  Most people saw him and were disgusted.  I think Jesus saw him and had compassion.  Jesus didn’t see him as an object of ridicule; He saw him as a soul to be saved.\n\n\n\n```\nOur call to war, to love the captive soul,\nBut to rage against the captor;\nAnd with the sword that makes the wounded whole,\nWe will fight with faith and valor.\nWhen faced with trials on every side,\nWe know the outcome is secure.\nAnd Christ will have the prize for which He died:\nAn inheritance of nations. \n```\n\n\n* No one is too far gone for the Savior.\n\n> *”9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.”*  (1Co 6:9-11 KJV)\n\n## About Salvation:\n* Salvation is for everybody who will receive it.\n* Salvation changes people.\n* Saved people should show and tell.",

    "body": "# Too Many Teachers! (James 3:1)\nYou know that I’m a great admirer of Charles Spurgeon.  Spurgeon is probably the greatest English-speaking preacher who ever lived.  He preached personally to more than 10,000,000 people in his lifetime, and his sermons were read every week as far away as American and Australia.  He wrote dozens of books.  He started very large orphanages.  He pastored the largest church in the world.  Amazingly, none of this seems to have gone to his head, and he stuck faithful to the Bible to the end.\n\nOne of Spurgeon’s most lasting accomplishments was starting a Bible college called “The Pastor’s College.”   It really was a new kind of school, and it was the forerunner for Bible colleges that are all over the place today.  The Pastor’s College trained over a thousand pastors who ministered all over the world.\n\nWhen I was reading one of the biographies of Spurgeon many years ago, one thing stood out to me about this pastor’s college:  Before anyone could join the pastor’s college and study to be a pastor, Spurgeon had to hear them preach.  If they didn’t have a natural ability to preach, then Spurgeon wouldn’t educate them.  He actually turned away a bunch of people from his college—not because they didn’t have character or good grades, but because they didn’t have preaching ability.\n\nI always thought that was strange.  When I went to Bible college, we used to joke that they would take anyone.   When I was coming up, it seemed like there was a great deal of pressure to become a preacher.  If you were a young man in the church and didn’t become a preacher, it was almost like you were a lesser Christian or something.  \n\nOur text tonight deals with this subject.  It’s just one verse, James 3:1.  Let’s read it:\n\n> *”My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.”* (James 3:1)\n---\n\nI want to preach to you tonight on the subject, “Too many preachers.”  \n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll get into that.**\n\nWe need more preachers and God-called, Spirit-filled Bible teachers.  Jesus only told us to pray for one specific thing, and it was that *“we would pray the Lord of the Harvest that He would send forth laborers into His harvest.”* We need more missionaries, pastors, and evangelists.\n\nBu at the same time, we need to apply the brakes because there are many people who want to be a pastor, a missionary, or some other Bible teacher for the wrong reason.  There are many people who aren’t qualified.  There are many people who aren’t gifted.  Some people see being a pastor as an easy life, or they see it as a path to prestige, so they take on what they were never called to do.\n\nAdam Clarke, a preacher and commentary writer from the early 1800s, said this about unqualified preachers:\n\n> They have not only sinned in thrusting themselves into that office to which God has never called them, but through their insufficiency, the flocks over whom they have assumed the mastery perish for lack of knowledge, and their blood will God require at the watchman’s hand.\n\nOuch.\n\nThat’s what James here is warning about when he says, *“Be not many masters.”* The word “masters” is “didaskalos.”  It’s the word that we get “didactic” from.  It’s a word that generally means “teachers,” but almost always in the New Testament, it’s talking about religious preachers.\n\nSo what James is saying here is, “Don’t all of you try to be the preacher, and don’t all of you try to be the Bible teacher.”  \n\nSo I’m going to give you a bunch of points tonight on this theme, but I’m going to break it into two main categories:\n\n1. The limiting of preachers.\n2. The liability of preachers.\n\nSo let’s look at the first point:\n\n## 1. The limiting of preachers.\nWhy should we limit who is and isn’t a preacher?  The Bible actually has a lot to say about this.\n\nJust in the New Testament, consider all the damage that was done by false or unqualified preachers:\n\n* In Acts 15:24, a group of preachers started adding the works of the law to Christianity, and they perverted the gospel and confused a lot of people.  Paul actually had to write the book of Galatians in response to these false teachers.\n* In Romans 2:17-29, it talks about preachers and teachers whose lives don’t match up to their message and how powerless and pointless that is.\n* In 1 Timothy 1:6-7 it says:\n\n> *”6 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling; 7 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.”*\n\nSo some people were preachers who had no idea what they were talking about, and it caused problems in the early church.\n\n* In 2 Timothy 4:3, it talks about how in the last days there would be preachers who scratched people’s ears, telling them what they want to hear rather than what the word of God says.\n\nIn other words, even in the Bible, even when Christianity was still very new, there were already lots of preachers who shouldn’t have been preachers, and they caused damage.  They perverted the truth; they confused people; they left people hungry for knowledge; they told people lies.  It’s a bad deal.\n\nThat’s just the New Testament.  All you have to do is read the prophetical books to see how often it references the false prophets and phony preachers in the Old Testament.  For every Elijah, there is a Balaam.  For every Aaron, their is a Korah.  For every Jeremiah, there is a clown telling people exactly what they want to hear.\n\nSo James is saying, “Don’t every one of you try to be preachers or Bible teachers.  Be very cautious about this.  Make sure you are qualified.  Make sure you know what you are getting into.”\n\nThe New Testament has several things to say about the qualifications for preachers, let me give you three of them:\n\nFirst, preachers should **have an ability to actually teach and preach.**  1 Timothy 3:2 says that pastors need to be *“apt to teach.”* That means they should actually have preaching ability.  They should be able to stand in front of people to speak and make sense.  \n\nThis is why Spurgeon wouldn’t take people into his college until he heard them preach.  He recognized that there are some people who have no business being preachers because they just can’t preach.  They mumble and jumble; they aren’t coherent; they shrink up when they are in front of people.\n\nI’m sure you know people who are like this.  There are people who tell themselves they that are preachers or called to pastor but who can’t preach.  It’s sad.\n\nA second thing the New Testament teaches us about teachers is that they should **labor in their teaching**.  2 Timothy 2:15-16 says:\n\n> *”15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. 16 But shun profane [and] vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.”*\n\n1 Timothy 5:15 says:\n\n> *”Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.”*\n\nPreaching is work.  It’s labor.  You have to labor in study.  You have to read constantly.  You have to make sure you aren’t misrepresenting God’s word and that you are *“rightly dividing the word of truth.”* You have to labor to understand what the Bible actually is saying, and then you have to labor to make it understandable to the people you are preaching to.\n\nIt takes hours and hours of work.  If a preacher is faithful, what you see when you hear a sermon is the tip of the iceberg.  \n\nSometimes people ask me what it’s like being a preacher, and I tell them it’s like having to write three college term papers every week, and then stand and deliver them to the same people week in and week out without boring them.  That is hard!\n\nA third thing you need to know about being a preacher is that you **shouldn’t be a novice**.    You shouldn’t rush into it.  Sometimes people get saved, and we try to make them preachers almost right away.  That’s usually a terrible idea.  Maybe we try to make people into pastors when they are still very, very young.  There have been great young preachers. Charles Spurgeon starting pastoring when he was 17. The evangelist James Stewart was preaching to great crowds when he was much younger than that.  I think Pastor Sexton was still in his teens when he started pastoring.\n\nBut for every Charles Spurgeon, Clarence Sexton, or James Stewart, there are dozens of young men who aren’t ready yet, who rush into preaching too soon, and who make a mess of it.  \n\nMan, I thought I was the cat’s meow when I was 22.  I was hot stuff.  I was so frustrated because I didn’t get to preach more.  I was constantly trying to jump out of the oven before I was done.\n\nThat seems like a long time ago, and I’m a much worse preacher than I was then.  I’ve got a long way to go.  I’m grateful to God that He surrounded me with wise people like Pastor Scallions who didn’t let me rush out as a novice.\n\nI had this friend many years ago who got saved in his twenties.  He had no church background, but man, he was zealous.  He almost immediately answered the call to preach, and it wasn’t a year later he was trying to leave and go out on his own and start a church.  You can guess how that went.  \n\nSo before you rush into a call to the ministry, or before you let someone else rush into a call to the ministry, know what you are getting into.  Make sure you actually have ability.  Make sure you know that it’s going to be studying, writing, delivering, repeating, every day, every week for a long, long time.  Make sure that you know that it’s going to require a long preparation time and that you can’t jump in as a novice.\n\nMake sure you are qualified.  *”Be not many masters.”*\n\nNow, the second half of the verse tells us why we shouldn’t all rush into being preachers.\n\n> *”knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.”*\n\nThe first point was the limiting of preachers.  The second point is...\n\n## 2. The liability of preachers.\nIn other words, James just didn’t say, “Don’t all of you rush to be preachers.” He gave us a reason: “Preachers will be held liable for their preaching. “ Put another way: “God is going to hold preachers responsible in a way that others are not.”\n\nThink about it this way:  Doctors have a greater liability than we do.  If they are preforming surgery and prescribing medicine, they are dealing with some powerful stuff.  They can miss a cancer diagnosis, or they can prescribe the wrong medicine that ruins your life.  They can cut out the wrong part in surgery and leave you impaired for life.\n\nWith the privilege of being a doctor comes a great responsibility.\n\nYears ago, there was a horrific school bus accident in the news (I think it was in Tennessee).  The driver had a history of reckless driving.  He’d been censured many times before.  One day he was driving like an idiot with a bus full of kids and ended up killing many of them.   That bus driver has a powerful tool—a huge bus—and a huge responsibility—the lives of precious children.  He’s going to live the rest of his life with the stain and responsibility of his wrongdoing.\n\nThe specific point James is making here is that teachers and preachers have one main tool and it’s a powerful one: The tongue.  Just like a doctor can do lots of damage with a prescription sheet and a bus driver can kill with a bus, anybody can cause lots of damage with their tongue.\n\nWhoever came up with “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me” needs to be hurt with sticks and stones because words can do lots and lots of damage.\n\nAll of us, whether we are a preacher or not, need to work on controlling our tongue.  That’s what next week’s message is about, but those of us who are preachers we have to be extra careful because this “fire that no man can tame” is our main tool.\n\nAnd we are going to stand before God and be judged for how we use it.  We have power, but with that power comes the greater opportunity to mess up and hurt people.\n\nSo what are the lessons here, let me give them to you and be done:\n\n1. If you ever feel “called to preach,” make very, very sure that it is God calling you, and that it isn’t motivated by ego or some other thing.\n2. If you are teaching the word of God—whether it is in a Sunday School class or behind a pulpit—remember that you have power and work hard at it.  Be careful what you say.\n3. Remember that all of us are going to give an account to God for our work on this earth. Preachers and Bible teachers will have a higher level of accountability.",

    "body": "I'm going to take a break from Acts this morning. The passage that I wanted to preach from, the story is really almost 2 whole chapters long, and I can't keep you long this morning because of that auction across the street. So I've decided to do something a little different.\n\nThere are a few passages of scripture that have changed me and shaped me more than anything. They've become filters for my thinking. They've shaped my worldview. One of those passages of scripture is the Sermon on the Mount. When I was in college I read a book about the sermon on the mount and it sparked my interest in it and I've read everything I could get ahold of on it since and it's really, really become something that has shaped the way I look at life.\n\nAnother one of those passages is the book of James. Specifically James 3. James 3 is a passage we know as the \"tongue\" chapter but it's really a checklist for leadership. That passage has changed me and I think about it all the time.\n\nBut there is probably no passage that I think about week to week, day to day more than the one we are going to look at today. It's unbelievably practical and unbelievably hard.\n\nI'm going to give you a list of the top ten most Christian things you can do. Sounds like one of those click bait blog posts doesn't it. The top 10 most Christian things you can do.\n\nBut before I give you the list I want to ask you a question. If you want to be a great Christian, what is the most important character trait to have?\n\nSome people would say obedience. That's fair. But it's possible to obey for the wrong reasons. The Pharisees were obedient for the most part - but they were doing it for the wrong reasons.\n\nSome people would say it's bible knowledge. Again, lots of people know the Bible and don't do anything about it. The devil knows the Bible far better than you or I do.\n\nSome people would say it's the ability to preach or the ability to teach. But that has nothing to do with Christian character.\n\nI know quite a lot of people who seem to think the greatest Christian character trait that you can have is being an obnoxious jerk. They read verses that tell us to \"earnestly contend for the faith\" and they think that gives us carte blanche to run roughshod over people.\n\nBut what does the Bible say? What is the the most important character trait for a great Christian to have? Let me read you a couple of verses and you tell me if it's not clear:\n\n\"And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.\" (1 Peter 4:8)\n\n\"Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.\" (1 John 4:7-8)\n\n\"By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\"\n\nOr how about this one:\n\n\"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\" (1 Corinthians 13:13)\n\nI think it's pretty clear don't you. The greatest character trait for a Christian to have is obedience. Just kidding, it's charity. It's love. Right?\n\nLook at 1 Corinthians 13 with me. This is the love chapter. Look at the first couple of verses:\n\n\"[1Co 13:1-3 KJV] 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become [as] sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 2 And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed [the poor], and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\"\n\nPaul was writing these words to the church at Corinth. They had a lot of problems. One of their big problems was that they were all show offs. They all wanted 'pulpit time.' They had this contorted view of spiritual gifts where they looked at them as almost like a talent show. Everyone was seeking attention for themselves.\n\nAnd Paul said - none of that matters. None of it is important unless you have charity. Unless you have true Christian love.\n\nThen, at the end of the chapter he writes:\n\n\"And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.\" (1 Corinthians 13:13)\n\nSo charity is important right.\n\nWell, that's not the practical part. That's not the part that challenges my thinking and acts like a filter for my behavior. You see, the real amazing part of this chapter isn't that Paul tells us how important charity is, it's that Paul tells us how charity acts.\n\nAnyone can say love is important. Even the Beatles said it over and over. But how does love act? How do you put that into practice? That's where most people are left scratching their heads. That's also where this chapter shines.\n\nVerses 4-7 tell us that. Let's read it, let's pray and then I'm going to give you the top ten most Christian things you can do:\n\n\"[1Co 13:4-7 KJV] 4 Charity suffereth long, [and] is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.\"\n\nLet's pray.\n\nTop ten most Christian things you can do. O.k., it's not a true top ten. They aren't in order of importance. They are all important. But top ten sounds better.\n\nLet's look at these.\n\nNumber 1, if you want to be a great Christian you should:\n\n1. Be inconvenienced and uncomfortable for people. (Suffereth long)\nThe verse says \"charity suffereth long.\"\n\nIf you want to be a great Christian, you have to be willing to be put out a little bit. You have to be willing to be a little uncomfortable sometimes.\n\nYou see this with a mother and her babies. A mom can say \"I love you\" until they are blue in the face, but they SHOW their love when that baby starts crying at 2am and they only slept an hour the night before. They show that love when instead of buying the dress they really want they get something for their kids instead. They show that love when they wait up by the hospital bed when their little one breaks his arm.\n\nNone of that is fun. Love doesn't make it easy. But that's what love does. It suffers long. It allows itself to be inconvenienced. It puts its plans on hold. It deprives itself of sleep, or temperature control, or comfort or whatever for the person it loves.\n\nSo do you want to be a Great Christian? It's going to cost you. You are going to have to suffer long for others.\n\nNumber 2. The second top ten Christian thing you can do is:\n\n2. Refuse to be mean. (Is kind)\nIt says \"Charity...is kind.\"\n\nThe dictionary defines kind as\n\nhaving or showing a friendly, generous, and considerate nature\n\nI don't know that that is very helpful. To me, the best way to define \"kind\" is by what kindness will not do. Kindness absolutely refuses to hurt other people. It's gentle. It isn't mean.\n\nSo if you want to really act like a Christian, stop yourself whenever you start saying something mean.\n\nLet me put it another way. When you are kind, you do nothing on purpose that would hurt somebody. You don't hurt people on purpose. You aren't out to destroy people.\n\nIf you listen to the rhetoric of the world, there is so much of this. So much that is intentionally hurtful. A lot of name calling. A lot of accusations.\n\nSometimes we have to say things that people don't like, but we only say it when it's for their good and we say it in the nicest kindest way we can.\n\nNumber 3:\n\n3. Be genuinely happy when others do better than you. (envieth not)\nThis might be the hardest thing on this list. Because it cuts right across our sinful human nature. We all want to be number one, and when someone does better than us, boy, we despise them for it.\n\nThat's not charity in action. That's selfishness in action. Charity says \"there is enough to go around. I'm glad my brother or my sister is getting this honor. God is being good to them.\"\n\nIt's so easy to get on facebook and see what other people are doing and think \"Wow, why do they get to live there?\" \"Or, they are doing so much better than me.\" And if you aren't careful, you start to despise them for it.\n\nA huge percentage of politics and advertising is based on envy. Let's be happy for others.\n\nNumber 4. The fourth top ten Christian thing you can do is:\n\n4. Refuse to toot your own horn. (vauteth not itself, is not puffed up)\n5. Don't be rude. (Work to make other people comfortable) (doth not behave itself unseemly)\n6. Look beyond \"what's in it for me\" (seeketh not her own)\n7. Be hard to offend. (is not easily provoked)\n8. Give people the benefit of the doubt. (thinketh no evil)\n9. Fight with principles, not personalities. Fight with facts, not feelings. (rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth.)\n10. Refuse to give up on people. (beareth all things..).\nConclusion\nJesus is the greatest example of all of these things",

    "body": "# Two Great Men\nI read a lot from a lot of different genres. But there is one thing I don’t ever read, I don’t ever read celebrity gossip magazines.  \n\nOh, but I see them.  You can’t go to the grocery store without seeing them, right there as you are waiting to check out.  “Angelina’s Revenge”, “Look who’s having twins.”  “Blake finally proposes.”  And so on and so forth, every week it’s something new.\n\nThere are three topics that fill up those celebrity magazines all the time: **One is royalty**.  Any time the royal family does anything it gets put in People or Star or whatever magazine you read.  Prince William wipes his knows.  Kate Middleton takes her kids to the zoo.  People will buy it and read it.  The second topic that will always sell magazines is **any kind of sex scandal**.  Someone cheats.  Someone gets a divorce.  Someone gets caught doing something they shouldn’t do.  The third topic that move gossip rags off of the shelf is **celebrity deaths**.  Kate Spade, Neil Diamond, Aretha Franklin, Anthony Bourdain - people want to read about it, so they get a special issue.\n\nBut imagine for a second that there was one story that was a convergence.  There is a story that involves all three.  The gossip mag sweet spot.  The Holy Grail.  A royal who has a scandal that involves a celebrity death.  That’s what we are going to read about here in Mark 6.\n\nOur text this morning is going to be Mark 6 verses 14 - 29.  Let’s open the Bible there and read it…\n\n> *”14 And king Herod heard [of him]; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him. 15 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet, or as one of the prophets. 16 But when Herod heard [thereof], he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead. 17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife: for he had married her. 18 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife. 19 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed him; but she could not: 20 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly. 21 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief [estates] of Galilee; 22 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give [it] thee. 23 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give [it] thee, unto the half of my kingdom. 24 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. 25 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist. 26 And the king was exceeding sorry; [yet] for his oath's sake, and for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her. 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison, 28 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the damsel gave it to her mother. 29 And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.”*\n\nI actually skipped this story last Sunday, not because it’s hard.  It’s pretty straightforward.  But because I was having a hard time coming up with the best way to preach it.\n\nIt’s really kind of a parenthesis in this passage.  Right before this Jesus sends out his disciples to preach.  Right after this the story goes right back to that.  In the middle we have this little bit about Herod and John the Baptist.\n\nSo let’s talk about Herod a little bit here.  Mark calls him King Herod.  He was called King Herod by the locals, but he wasn’t actually a king.  It was a term of derision.  His father had been a king who worked under the Roman Government, and when his father had died he divvied up his kingdom into three and gave a part to each of his three sons.  Herod got the part with Galilee in it.  The part where Jesus would do most of his ministry.\n\nHerod really wanted to be a king but he couldn’t have that title without the Roman Emperors permission.  He begged and begged for it and annoyed the fire out of the emperor, but he never got the title.  So a lot of people think that Mark is using the title “King Herod” here ironically and a little mockingly.\n\nHerod had it all though.  He really did.  He had wealth that most people could only dream of.  He had power.  He was the leader of a country.    He was following in his father’s footsteps and building these awesome building projects around Palestine.  \n\nEarly on he married a princess from a neighboring country.  After awhile he took his princess to visit Rome and while in Rome he met his brother’s wife, a girl named Herodius.  He actually fell for his own brother’s wife and they made secret plans.  When he got back to Palestine, he divorced his princess wife and he married his brother’s wife.  This actually started a war. His ex-father in law wasn’t happy about this.  So they went to war and Herod’s army actually lost.\n\nSo Herod has it all.  He has armies.  He has cities.  He has wealth. He has power.  He’s in the upper echelons of society.  He does what he wants, when he wants, even if it means starting a war.\n\nBut when Herod hears about Jesus, He’s scared.  Listen to that.  He’s scared.\n\nThis man has his own country.  This man has his own army.  This man has his own impregnable fortress with a dungeon underneath on a mountain in the desert like some kind of James Bond villain.  And yet this man, this great Herod, is scared when he hears about Jesus.\n\nWhy? What could make this man afraid?  I mean, he wasn’t afraid to pester the most powerful person in the whole world for a meaningless title.  He wasn’t afraid to steal his brother’s wife.  He wasn’t afraid to go to war with his ex-father in law.  \n\nSo what is He scared of?  \n\nLook at verse 16:\n\n> *” But when Herod heard [thereof], he said, It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.”*\n\nThis great man, as far as the world was concerned, was terrified of another great man - John the baptist.  Even though Herod had been the one who killed John the baptist.\n\nNow, there are a bunch of lessons that I think we can learn from this story of Herod and John the Baptist, but I’m going to keep it to three this morning.  \n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll jump into that.**\n\nThe three lessons of this passage are kind of scattershot. There is no theme.  I’m just going to look at this story that involves two very different kinds of great men: John the Baptist and Herod and preaching on some of the things that jumped out at me.\n\nThe first lesson I want to preach on is this…\n\n## 1. Be careful about following your heart, especially when your heart leads you into sin.  \n\nOne of the great lies society tells us all the time is “follow your heart.”  “If it feels right, do it.”  \n\nNow, most of the time, I think they are talking about having dreams and goals.  That’s a good thing.  But sometimes they are saying that the only thing that matters is our happiness and we should do whatever makes us happy.\n\nGod’s word says the heart is “deceitful above all things and desperately wicked” but the world says “follow your heart.”\n\nThat’s what Herod did. Herod was definitely what the ancients called an Epicurean.  He was someone who believed that happiness came through satisfying yourself.\n\nHe saw something he wanted - he saw Herodius - his brother’s wife and he went for it.  Even though he was married.  Even though she was married.  Even though it would cause lots and lots of problems.  He couldn’t say no to himself.\n\nThe book of Proverbs has several warnings about this.  Let me read you just one of them.  Proverbs 5:3-6:\n\n> *”[Pro 5:3-6 KJV] 3 For the lips of a strange woman drop [as] an honeycomb, and her mouth [is] smoother than oil: 4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, [that] thou canst not know [them].”*\n\nSolomon was warning his son about dead end streets and right at the beginning the one dead end street he mentions over and over again is adultery.  \n\nHe says he eyes may be pretty, her mouth may be smooth, but her end is bitter as wormwood.  She’s going to pull you down into hell.\n\nMen, every one of us know people who have fallen into the adultery trap, and every one of us know there is temptation there.  Our culture winks at it, the movies glorify it.  They never show the pain.  They rarely show the heartache.  \n\nOur Lord Jesus is pictured as the great bridegroom and we as husbands are supposed to love our wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it.  If we give into that temptation, if we flirt with the girl at work, no matter how much we rationalize it, we are acting exactly opposite of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\nHerod wanted Herodius.  Herod got Herodius.  He stole a woman from another man - his own brother.  He cast aside the wife of his youth.  Do you know what?  She was nothing but problems.  She literally caused a war.  In this story she exploited her daughter in front of a bunch of drunken men so that she could get rid of John the Baptist, which no doubt caused Herod all kinds of political problems.  She was a pain in his side.\n\nI just want to warn you men, warn you ladies.  It’s not worth it.  It may look sweet, but it’s end is bitter as wormwood.  It’s the road to hell.  Run, don’t walk, away from that temptation.\n\nThat’s the first lesson I see in this story. But let’s look deeper.\n\n---\n\nVerse 18 tells us how John the Baptist got involved with a guy like Herod.  Remember, John the Baptist was a preacher.  He was specially sent by God to prepare people’s hearts for Jesus.  He lived in the wilderness.  He wore the clothes of an old timey prophet.  He didn’t talk like everyone else, didn’t dress like everyone else, and didn’t eat what everyone else ate.\n\nAnd John the Baptist wasn’t afraid to preach about Herod and Herod’s adultery and point out the obvious - that it was wrong.  It was sinful.\n\nSo Herodius, Herod’s squeeze, heard about John’s preaching and she wanted it over.  She wanted him shut up.  I think what these verses are saying is that she was going to put a hit job on John the Baptist.  She was going to have him quietly killed and when Herod heard about what his new wife was going to do he said “No, no, that will cause all kinds of problems with the people.  The people love John the Baptist.”  So instead Herod locked John up in his special prison.\n\nYou should read about this prison.  It was called Macherus.  Herod had built this palace on a little Mountian right next to the Dead Sea.  It was absolutely desolate, but it was also the perfect natural fortification.  In the basement there was a dungeon and that’s where they put John the baptist.  \n\nIt had to be terrible.  But at least he was safe there from Herodius who wanted to kill him.\n\nBut look at verse 20.  This has to be one of the most interesting verses in this whole story:\n\n> *”For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.”*\n\nDid you catch what that said?  Herod was afraid of John The Baptist. Even though John The Baptist was in his dungeon, He was afraid of him.\n\nO.k.  But what’s really interesting is what what the second half of that verse says, it says that Herod heard him gladly.  Herod, for whatever reason, enjoyed listening to John The Baptist.  \n\nNow think about this - Herod was at the top echelon’s of society - John The Baptist was completely outside of society.  Herod lived in palaces.  John lived in the desert.  Herod ate the best meals prepared by the best chefs.  John ate locusts and wild honey.  Herod wore beautiful, custom tailored clothing of only the finest cloths and colors.  John wore a coat of camel hair and a big leather belt.  \n\nBut Herod respected John.  Herod had to listen to John.  Even though John was preaching against Herod’s lifestyle, there was something about John the Baptist that drew Herod in and he recognized that John had power.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point…\n\n## 2. A person who has genuine conviction and speaks the truth is a powerful force in the world.\n\nJohn’s power was the same power that you and I can have.  He was filled with the Spirit.  He was filled with the word of God.  He was a person of conviction.  He was a person who spoke the truth, even when it wasn’t popular.  He didn’t care what people thought of him or what was fashionable in the world - He was different.\n\nIf you want to make a difference in this world - you have to be different. Nothing is made better by adding more of the same.  \n\nI think a lot of people have this idea that the way we are going to win the world to Christ is to be just like them. Dress just like them.  Adapt music that is just like theres.  Make our church like a night club.  Bring Starbucks in the lobby.  Bring beer into the fellowship.\n\nAnd make no mistake about it, that kind of church *is* popular, just like Herod was popular. But it doesn’t make much of a difference.  To make a difference you have to stand for something.  To make a difference you have to speak the truth.  To make a difference you have to march by the beat of a different drummer.\n\nHow about you?  Do the people you work with see you as different?  Not weird, but a person of conviction, a person that has the Holy Ghost inside you, a person who is led by different forces than the world around us?  Or are you a chameleon?  A Christian secret agent.\n\nListen, do you know what people respect?  They respect people who are real. They respect people who have some truth to them.  Who have some conviction. They might not like you - but they can’t ignore you.\n\nBloody Mary said the thing she feared most in all of Scotland was John Knox on his knees.  Benjamin Franklin was not a believer, but he really had to wrestle with George Whitfield.  Thomas Jefferson was an out skeptic who read his bible with a pen knife cutting out all the parts he didn’t like - but Thomas Jefferson had to listen to the Baptist John Leland, and even invited him to preach to a joint session of congress.\n\nThe point is this, if you have genuine conviction, if you are full of the Holy Ghost, if you speak the truth - that’s a power that even the most powerful in the world find fascinating.\n\nAnd that brings me to my last point.  You see, Herod in this story found John fascinating.  He heard him gladly. But that’s where it ended.\n\n## 3. You can enjoy listening to hard preaching, and yet still be lost.\n\nHerod heard a lot of John The Baptist’s preaching.  He liked it. He might have felt convicted.  He might have gone home and played with his kids a bit more.  He might have made some minor moral changes in his life.  He liked the hard preaching.  \n\nBut Herod wasn’t a believer.  Herod still ushered the order to have John The Baptist killed.  He still was influential in putting Jesus on the cross.\n\nYou might be here because you like Bible preaching.  You might like it when the preacher preaches it straight.  You might even enjoy it when the preacher preaches against sin.  But you can still be lost.\n\nThe truth is, there is a danger in hard preaching. There is a danger in preaching against sin.  It can give you the false impression that the way to salvation is reforming yourself.   Just getting rid of the sin.\n\nBut the truth is there are stains in your life and in mine that no amount of reformation is going to wipe clean.  The Bible says \n\n> *”For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.”*\n\nIt says \n\n> *”There is none righteous, no, not one.”*\n\nThe truth is it doesn’t matter if you are a wicked lout like Herod or the purist of John The Baptist’s disciples.  You are a sinner.\n\nAnd the penalty for sin is death and hell.  Everyone of us is going to stand before a holy God some day and be judged for our sins.\n\nBut God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son.  He sent Jesus to live the life we can’t live and then to die on the cross in our place.\n\n*”And whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.”*\n\n\nDon’t be like Herod.  Don’t just listen over and over.  I’m glad you hear preaching gladly, but that isn’t enough to get to heaven.  To get to heaven we have to put our faith and trust in what Jesus Christ has done for us on the cross.\n\nAre you saved?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "# Mark 6:1-13 - Two things that ruin any ministry.\n\nDo you know any celebrities?  I mean do you really know them?  Most of us don’t.  Most of us can only read about their weird lives in magazines (and if you do, you should find better things to read) or tell stories about bumping into them here or there.  \n\nI’ve silently shared meals with the former Vice President and knew a few minor political figures. I once got to hang out with the actor Corbin Bernsen for a few minutes at a soap box derby, but beyond that, I have no cool celebrity stories.\n\nI’ve met some people who grew up with celebrities.  My stepdad was childhood friends with Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Glavine.  Adam Sandler went to the same high school as my stepmother.  That’s about all I have.\n\nWhat do you think it’s like when a celebrity comes home for Thanksgiving dinner?  Do you think it’s awkward?  I imagine it’s just really, really weird.  Bob’s a plumber, his brother Joe is the night manager at Walmart, his sister Susie is a stay-at-home mom, and their other brother, Jimmy, is the starting quarterback for the 49ers.  I imagine that makes for some strange dinner conversation.\n\nIn this story, Jesus, who at this point is a major celebrity and who has a major reputation around Israel and beyond, goes home.  He goes to His home synagogue, and He preaches there.\n\nIt’s the same message that has caused multitudes to believe over and over in the gospel.  It’s the same power that’s healed people and cast out demons all over Israel.  There is nothing wrong with Jesus.  He’s still as powerful and persuasive as ever.  Yet, it just doesn’t work in His hometown.\n\nLet’s read verses 1-6…\n\n> *”1 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him. 2 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him. 4 But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house. 5 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. 6 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about the villages, teaching.”*.  (Mar 6:1-6 KJV)\n\nNow let’s talk about what went on here.  Jesus had preached at His home synagogue before.  The first time they got mad and tried to throw Him off a cliff, so there was that.\n\nThen a couple chapters ago, His family had come to stage a kind of intervention and try to make Him come home, thinking He was crazy, so there was that.\n\nSo why did Jesus go home to Nazareth at all?  \n\nWe don’t know.  We can only speculate.  Maybe it was the success He had calming the sea and healing the demoniac of Gadara.  Maybe it was just homesickness and longing to see familar faces.  I don’t know.  Jesus is God and Jesus has perfect knowledge, but He was also fully man and I know he cared for His family.\n\nI love Mattoon.  I really do.  This is home now.  This is my kids’ home, but there is still something special that happens every time I drive through Hudson, New Hampshire, when I see the Dunkin Donuts where I worked in high school and the Papa Gino’s where I went on my first date.  There is something special about driving down Pheasant Street and up my parents’ driveway and standing in my mom’s kitchen.  Some days I really want to go to my brother Tim’s house and play Horse with him in the basketball hoop in his driveway.  You get that.\n\nMaybe it was that kind of thing that brought Jesus home.  At any rate, Jesus was careful this time.  The first time Jesus went to Nazareth to preach, He preached alone, but this time He brought the disciples.  Jesus waited until the sabbath.  It seems like Jesus was trying not to ruffle any feathers.\n\nAnd Jesus stood up and preached in the synagogue, and He preached the same message He always preached; just as powerful; just as persuasive.  But this time, His **reception** was different.\n\nThe Bible says, *”and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands? 3 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.”*\n\nLet’s break that down:\n\nFirst thing they asked was: Where is this coming from?  Where did this guy get this wisdom and this power?  They weren’t doubting Jesus’ wisdom or power; they were just baffled about its source.  They knew Jesus.\n\nThe second question they asked is, *”Is not this the carpenter?”* Apparently, Jesus worked as a carpenter in Nazareth.  They didn’t know Him as Jesus the preacher; they knew Him as Jesus the guy down the street to go to when you needed your window repaired or your wagon wheel mended.  Being a carpenter is an honorable profession.  I come from a long line of carpenters.  I’m proud of that, but this wasn’t a compliment. Carpenters aren’t philosophers.  Carpenters aren’t usually world changers.\n\nThe next thing they asked is, *”(is not this) the son of Mary?”*. Again, this wasn’t a compliment.  This was probably an underhanded slur.  You didn’t call people by their mother’s name in Israel.  They would have normally said, “The son of Joseph.” By saying, “The son of Mary,” they were probably hinting at Jesus being an illegitimate son.  They were probably throwing shade here.\n\nThen they mentioned Jesus’ brothers—four of them—and His sisters, about whom we know nothing.   \n\nThey were offended at Jesus.  They couldn’t deny that Jesus had power.  They couldn’t deny that Jesus had done great things, but they couldn’t handle it either.\n\nAnd what was the result of this?  Look at verse 5:\n\n> *”And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.”*\n\nJesus’ ministry was hindered big time.  Demons, sickness, powerful forces of evil, leprosy, and even death are no match for Jesus, but His ministry was hindered in this town—in His own town—by the people he preached to.\n\nNow I want to talk this morning for a few minutes about two things that hinder ministry—two things that hinder the work of God.  They aren’t the only two things, but they are two things we see in this story.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I want God to work in me and through me.  I want to see God do something awesome in and through our church.  I’ve got big dreams for our church.\n\n* We had 110 attendees last week.  I’d love to see a day when it’s regularly 300.\n* We are baptizing three folks this week.  Praise the Lord.  Wouldn’t it be awesome to see that every week or even every month?\n* By God’s grace, we had our first teen youth night this week and we had 8 teenagers show up.  That’s awesome, but wouldn’t it be great to have twenty or thirty?\n* We see this missionaries and church planters come through here looking for support.  I’ve always wanted to pastor the kind of church where young people from that church are surrendering to the mission field.\n* We’ve seen some folks get saved this year.  Wouldn’t it wonderful to see that often—to have people regularly give testimony that the grace of the gospel changed their lives and that God used Bible Baptist to do it?\n\nNow those might seem like huge goals, but they are really not.  God does that kind of thing all over the place.  There are hundreds of churches in towns like this where that kind of thing is happening, and I think even that is just scratching at the surface of what God can do.\n\nWhat do you want God to do in your family?  What do you want God to do in your life?  What do you think He can do?\n\nListen: I want God to work here, but this passage us teaches us that there are two things—again, they aren’t the only two things—that hinder the work of God.\n\n* It isn’t a lack of money or a down economy.\n* It isn’t a lack of talent.\n* It isn’t persecution.\n* It isn’t a hostile government.\n* It isn’t a crowd of enemies.\n\nNone of those things have ever slowed down the work of God, but these two things can.\n\nWhat are they? They are envy and unbelief.\n\nLet’s look at those two things:\n\n## 1. Envy can slow down God’s work.\n\nNotice that Jesus didn’t have trouble finding acceptance anywhere else besides His hometown.  When He preached there, they couldn’t deny His power, and they couldn’t deny His wisdom.  Here is what I think happened. I think the little green monster of envy crept out, and they just couldn’t stand the thought that someone they knew—someone they grew up with—was doing so much better than they were.\n\nThat’s envy.  Envy is a destructive force in churches.  It’s like a wrecking ball.\n\nJames 3:14-16 says this about envy in the church:\n\n> *”But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.”*\n\nEnvy will destroy your church. It will destroy your family, and it will hinder your own personal walk with God.  Jealousy will hinder God’s work in your life.\n\nWhen you stop counting your blessings and start counting other people’s and complaining, you are in trouble.  When you start muttering to yourself, “Why does He get to do that? I’m just as good as Him,” or “Why do they get that? We work just as hard as them,” you are hindering God’s work in your own life.  You are stopping your own blessings.\n\nWhen you start pointing your fingers at your brothers and sisters in Christ and letting envy grow in your heart at their position, their success, their ministry, their whatever, you are inviting confusion and every evil work, and you are scuttling God’s work.\n\nRefuse to be envious.  It will hinder God’s work.\n\n---\n\nBut envy isn’t the main thing that hinders God’s work in this story.  It’s definitely there, but it’s secondary.\n\nVerse 6 in our text says: \n\n> *”And he marvelled because of their unbelief.”*\n\nIt’s interesting. There are only two things in all of the gospels that make Jesus marvel: Faith and unbelief.  Jesus didn’t marvel at nature.  Jesus didn’t marvel at the Roman government.  Jesus didn’t marvel at the architecture of the temple.  The only things He marveled at were people’s faith or people’s unbelief.  There were times when Jesus saw the faith of a Gentile and He “marveled at their faith.” Here Jesus “marveled because of their unbelief.”\n\nThink about this.  These people knew Jesus.  They knew God incarnate! I mean He was their second cousin; He was their go-to carpenter; His brothers were on their football team.\n\nAnd they saw Jesus’ miracles.  They saw the changing of water into wine.  They saw the demons cast out and the sick healed.  \n\nThey heard the very words of God out of His mouth. Yet, they still didn’t believe.\n\nWhy? They didn’t want to.\n\nOh, let this be a warning to you, folks.  It’s possible to see God’s work firsthand—to see God totally change people and see God work miracles in people’s lives—and just write it off as something else and refuse to believe.\n\nUnbelief.\n\nListen: Envy can hinder God’s work and...\n\n## 2. Unbelief can slow down God’s work.\n\nGod works in our life through faith.  It is through faith that we believe the gospel and are saved.  It is through faith that we live the Christian life and grow in Christ.  It is through faith that we share the gospel and see God work through us in others.  It is through faith that we defeat the world, the flesh, and the devil.\n\n* Romans 1:17 says, *”The just shall live by faith.”*\n* 2 Cor. 5:7 says, *”For we walk by faith, not by sight:”*\n* Heb. 11:6 says, *”But without faith it is impossible to please him:”*\n* 1 John 5:5 says, *”And this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.”*\n\nIf we refuse to believe, God’s not going to be able to work in us and through us.",

    "body": "# Mark 5:21-43 (Jairus and the woman with the issue of blood)\n\nLet’s get started this morning by reading our text, Mark 5:21-43.\n\n> *”21 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea. 22 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet, 23 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the point of death: [I pray thee], come and lay thy hands on her, that she may be healed; and she shall live. 24 And [Jesus] went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him. 25 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years, 26 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse, 27 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched his garment. 28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole. 29 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in [her] body that she was healed of that plague. 30 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes? 31 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? 32 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing. 33 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague. 35 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's [house certain] which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further? 36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe. 37 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 38 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly. 39 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth. 40 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying. 41 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise. 42 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was [of the age] of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment. 43 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and commanded that something should be given her to eat.”*  (Mar 5:21-43 KJV)\n\nWhat was the longest night of your life?\n\nWhen Audrey was one year old, we started looking at her pictures, and we noticed that in almost all of them, she had this weird white eye.  I’d worked in a photo lab.  I’d seen a lot of red-eye photos, but this was different. It was in almost all of her candid photos.  We also had people start coming to us and telling us that they noticed that one of her eyes was lazy and didn’t focus with the other.\n\nSo like any good parents, we went on Google (bad idea).  It turns out that there is a very aggressive form of cancer called retinoblastoma that kills kids all the time, and that the easiest way to spot it is—you guessed it—white eyes in baby photos.\n\nSo we went to the doctor.  The doctor looked in her eye (not an easy thing to do with a one-year-old).  “That’s weird. I’ve never seen anything like that before. We need to get an MRI.”  So we go to the hospital, and they put our little baby to sleep. Then they put her in that machine, and when it’s over, we go home and wait for the results.\n\nWe get a call from her doctor that night at 11 P.M.  I don’t know how many of you have had your doctor call at 11 P.M., but that’s not normal practice.  He tells us that she has something called a glioma on her optic nerve inside of her brain.  He told us there was a chance it was cancerous, and there was a chance it was a sign of another disease. If she had that, then she would get these tumors all over her body for the rest of her life.\n\nObviously, you know the end of this story.  Audrey’s fine.  She doesn’t see out of one eye, but you’d never know it.  She doesn’t have cancer, and she doesn’t have tumors growing all over her body.  But it took a year and a lot of trips to the hospital to figure that out. \n\nThat night when we got that doctor’s call was the longest night of my life.  I thought I was going to lose my little girl or at least see her go through unimaginable pain.  \n\nI tell you that story because I sympathize with the Jairus in this story.   His little girl was dying.  If you’ve ever seen one of your little ones sick or been told they have some disease, then you know.  It’s tough.  This was his only daughter.  She was 12.  She was on her deathbed, and there was nothing this man could do.  \n\nThe other main character in this story is a little harder for me to relate to personally.  There was a woman who had “an issue of blood.”  That means there was something wrong in her reproductive system, and she was hemmoraging a small amount of blood constantly.\n\nThat doesn’t sound like a big deal.  It’s not life-threatening; a little gross, but that’s it.\n\nBut she was a Jew, so it was a very, very big deal.  It meant that she would be divorced from her husband.  It meant that she would be ceremonially unclean and barred from the synagogue and from the temple court.  It meant her social, religious, and family life were cut off from her.\n\nI read this illustration someone wrote from her point of view, and I’m going to read it to you because I think it will help you understand what this lady was going through:\n\n\n```\nI’d gotten used to the bleeding. And the weakness that went along with it. But it was the loneliness that consumed me.\n\nFor twelve years, my body has unnaturally bled. At first I thought it was just my monthly courses run long, but then it didn’t stop. I tried to hide it from my family of course, smuggling out the dirty rags to wash down at the river. But nothing gets past my mother. When she found out she just gave me that look, you know the one, the one that told me that I was a complete failure – worthless. Whatever was she going to do with an unclean daughter?\n\nAt first they tried to take me to doctors. Always the Roman doctors, not the Jewish ones – they didn’t want it getting out in our community that I was unclean. The doctors were more than willing to take my parents’ money, but nothing they did helped. The bleeding just continued – and I grew weaker and weaker. When it got to the point that I was too weak to even help my mother with the chores, my father had the idea to marry me off as quickly as possible. I assume he knew that my condition would be discovered, but then I would be another man’s problem.\n\nI’m surprised I survived the night my husband found out the truth. I think I passed out sometime after the third blow weak as I was. The next thing I knew he had thrown me at my father’s doorstep – demanding payment for the humiliation of having been given worthless goods. My father, of course, denied knowing anything at all – calling me a deceptive harlot, spitting in my face, and saying that I was no daughter of his.\n\nNow everyone knew I was unclean. No one could touch me, and everything I touched or anywhere I sat immediately became unclean. No shopkeeper would allow me near his wares; no housewife would allow me to pause to catch my breath on her doorstep. I begged as best I could for the occasional bite of bread, as my condition even barred me from the profession most desperate women end up turning to. No one wanted me.\n\nSo like I said, I got used to the bleeding and the weakness, but the loneliness got to me. No one’s touched me for nearly twelve years. Oh, I’ve been spat upon and received the occasional kick from daring young boys – but no hugs, no shoulder to cry upon, no sister to help braid my hair. And it’s been that long since I’ve been allowed in the synagogue as well – to raise my voice in praise to God or hear the precious words of the Torah read. I am as invisible and worthless to God as I am to everyone else.\n```\n\nSo for the same time that Jairus had been enjoying his only daughter, this lady had been living this little hell of ostracization and loneliness because of this silly disease.  She did what anyone would do in her situation: She sought help.\n\nVerse 26 says: \n\n> *”And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse”*\n\nShe went to the doctors.  Now I don’t want to disparage doctors, but sometimes, even today, they don’t know what they are doing.  I’m not saying I could do better; just that they don’t always get it right.\n\nJewish literature gives us all kinds of kooky remedies that the doctors were to try for this particular disease.  Listen to this:\n\n> Rabbi Jochanan says: \"Take of gum Alexandria, of alum, and of crocus hortensis, the weight of a zuzee each; let them be bruised together, and given in wine to the woman that hath an issue of blood.” But if this fail, \"Take of Persian onions nine logs, boil them in wine, and give it to her to drink: and say, Arise from thy flux.” But should this fail, \"Set her in a place where two ways meet, and let her hold a cup of wine in her hand; and let somebody come behind and affright her, and say, Arise from thy flux.\"\n\n“Practicing medicine,” right?\n\nSo this story paints for us two desperate characters: One about to lose his daughter and one who has lost twelve years to a terrible disease.  I want to focus on these characters this morning and first show you the contrast between them—or what set them apart from each other—and then look at the common faith they had. Lastly, we’ll talk about what we have in common with them.\n\nLet’s pray and I’ll give you those points.\n\nThe first thing I want you to see this morning is…\n\n# The Contrast Between These Characters\nFrom society’s standpoint, you would be hard pressed to find two more different characters than Jairus and this woman.\n\nTo start, one was a man, and the other was a woman.  In a very paternalistic society, people would have viewed Jairus as far more valuable than this woman, even if there was nothing wrong with her.\n\nSecondly, Jairus was a respected leader of the synagogue—something like a pastor today—but it was an unpaid position.  Likely, Jairus was very wealthy and very well connected.  This woman, on the other hand, was rejected and viewed as unclean from the synagogue.  She was rejected by the very society that Jairus was in charge of.\n\nJairus had a happy family and lots of friends.  This woman would have been an outcast from her family and friends and deemed untouchable.\n\nFor twelve years, Jairus has been enjoying the happiness of his daughter.  For those same twelve years, this woman has been a lonely outcast, spending all her money on quack doctors and hopeless cures.\n\nTo sum it up, Jairus is on the top of society.  This woman is on the bottom.  Jairus is seen by society as a winner.  This woman as the ultimate loser.\n\nIt would be hard to come up with two people more different than these two, but what did they have in common?\n\nLet’s look at…\n\n# The Commonality Between These Characters\nWhy is this one story?  If both of these people are so different, why does every gospel put these two stories together as one?  What’s the common theme here?\n\nI think it’s this: Both of these people came to Jesus by faith.\n\nNow, think about what their faith was like.  \n\n### It was a superstitious faith.\n\nJairus had it in his mind that Jesus had to come into the girl’s presence and lay hands on her for her to be healed.  He must have been thinking Jesus had some kind of magic ability or something.  This woman had no doubt heard that holy men’s shadow or clothes could be holy and have healing power, and so she just wanted to get a hold of His clothes.\n\nBoth of those things sound kind of superstitious, almost like they are going to a medicine man or something, and we know that Jesus isn’t like that.  But they came.\n\nA second thing I notice about their faith is that…\n\n### It was a hesitant faith\n\nMany commentators and preachers have pointed out that Jairus, as the ruler of the synagogue, was a Pharisee.  At the very best, he was probably on the fence about Jesus, but it’s very likely he was opposed to Him. It wasn’t until he had no other option—until the doctors said “there is nothing more that we can do”—that he humbled himself and came to Jesus.\n\nThen you look at this woman, and she seems equally bold and timid.  She’s bold to push herself into this crowd where she isn’t wanted, but she doesn’t have the boldness to ask Jesus. She wants to just reach out and touch His clothes, hoping He won’t even notice.\n\nThey were both hesitant.\n\nA third thing about their faith is…\n\n### It was an ignorant faith\n\nYou can read this whole chapter, and nothing gives you the sense that either Jairus or this woman fully grasped who Jesus was. They knew He was special.  They knew He was a healer.  But you never get the idea that they recognized that He was Messiah, the Son of God.  They came with what little knowledge they had, and it was just a little knowledge.\n\nThey were ignorant.\n\nSo why did they come—superstitious, hesitant, and ignorant?  They came because they had…\n\n### A Desperate Faith\n\n# The Commonality Between Them and Us",

    "body": "When I was in college, on the first day of every class we did something boring.  The teacher passed out this piece of paper called the syllabus and then read and explained it to us.  Every single class started this way.  Sometimes it was really, really boring.\n\nBut it was also super important.  That syllabus was the “how to” manual for the class.  It laid out how you could get an A and what the teacher expected from you.  It told you all of your assignments and tasks and when the big tests were going to be.  It might have been boring, but we still paid attention, because it was vital information.\n\nWhat I’m going to talk about this morning might seem a little bit boring.  But it is absolutely one of the most important lessons you could ever learn as a Christian and it will help you every day.  It is the big “how to” lesson of the Christian life.  It is the syllabus for Christian living.\n\nWe are just going to look at three short verses this morning in Galatians 5, but they teach us the central guiding principle of how to live as a Christian.  I’m going to read Galatians 5:16-18 and pray and then I’m going to give you three points this morning:\n* The concept\n* The conflict\n* The course of action\n\nLet’s look at those verses:\n\n> *”16 [This] I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. 17 For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. 18 But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.”*\n\n***Let’s pray.***\n\n# 1. The concept\nIf I were to summarize the entire book of Galatians up to this point it would be with this sentence: **You are not saved by the law, but by grace.** \n\nOver and over again I’ve been hammering this through this book.  We aren’t saved because of our righteousness, but because of Christ’s righteousness.  It’s not because of what we have done, but because of what He has done.\n\nI was talking to my stepdad yesterday and he was telling me that he got a unique opportunity.  He’s not a preacher, but he was asked to officiate his uncle’s funeral this last week.  Now, that area has almost no evangelical churches - he was preaching to a bunch of lost people.  So he wanted to be very clear in how he presented the gospel and the way he did it was genius.  He talked about the thief on the cross.\n\nHave you ever thought about this?  The thief on the cross wasn’t their like Jesus - as an innocent.  The thief deserved to be on that cross.  He was getting his just desserts.  He had no good works he could rest on - if he did - he wouldn’t have been on the cross.   He had no opportunity to be baptized or catechized or christened.  \n\nYet what did Jesus say to the thief on the cross?  He said “This day you shall be with me in paradise.”  The thief on the cross got saved, he went to heaven that day.  Not because of his works - he didn’t have any - but because of Christ’s work on his behalf.\n\nListen - that is how salvation works.  It’s by grace.  It’s not your Sunday school attendance record or your moral checklist that is going to get you into heaven - it’s Jesus work on the cross.\n\nSo you are not saved by the law, but by grace.  That’s the major theme of Galatians.  But in chapter 5 Paul introduces another concept - the concept of **liberty**.  Paul says that we are free from the law in our Christian life.\n\nNow - a lot of people are willing to say “I believe we are saved by grace - but then we have to live by the law.  If we don’t live by the law, if we don’t give people this checklist and these rules, then they are just going to live fleshly lives.”\n\nAnd that is what this passage is teaching us.  It is making a second major point.  Remember the first major point is “You aren’t saved by the law, but by grace.”  The second major point is…\n\n**You aren’t sanctified by the law, but by the Spirit.”**\n\nIn other words, you don’t live your Christian life and become more like Christ by the law - you do that by the Spirit.\n\nLet me read you an absolutely brilliant paragraph I picked up this week studying\n\n> ”Just as Jesus Christ is the primary Person behind justification, the Holy Spirit is the primary person behind sanctification.  A believer can no more sanctify himself than he could have saved himself in the first place.  He cannot live the Christian life by his own resources any more than he could have saved himself by his own resources.”\n\nThat’s it.\n\nJustification - that’s how we are saved.  Sanctification is another big word for how we live the Christian life and become more Christlike and defeat sin.  \n\nIt’s not like Jesus says “I took care of the salvation part - now you are on your own.” No!  He gives us the Holy Spirit to help us with Sanctification.\n\nNow, I’m not even to the big concept yet.  Ok.  So these jews would say “You can’t have liberty, you can’t be free from the law, or people will just do whatever they want and live in their flesh.”\n\nAnd Paul says “No.  Walk in the Spirit.  And you won’t live in the flesh.”\n\nSo here is the point - if you are walking in the Spirit then you will have victory over the flesh and you won’t live a flesh directed life.  You won’t live a life of sin. You won’t need the law and the rulebooks because they are external motivation and you will have internal motivation to live for God.\n\nLet me ask you something - how many of you have a “Do not litter” sign posted in your back yard?\n\nAnybody?  Well how do you ever keep your back yard clean?  How do you keep the trash out of your back yard?\n\nYou don’t need the “do not litter” sign because it’s your yard right? And you want to keep it clean.  That internal motivation is 1,000,000 more powerful than a sign somewhere that says “thou shalt not.”\n\nListen, the law and legalism, at it’s best it’s a “no littering” sign.  It’s external motivation. It can’t do much.  But if it’s in your heart, then you are going to do the right thing and not sin anyways.\n\nSo that is the concept - the real way to live the Christian life is by living in the Spirit and when you do that, you’ll defeat the flesh.\n\nSo that brings me to the second point this morning…\n\n\n# 2. The conflict\nLook at verse 17:\n\n> *”For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.”*\n\nLet’s break this down a little bit and talk about this.\n\nThe first thing you have to know is that **each of us have inside of us a carnal, sinful nature and have carnal, sinful desires (the lusts of the flesh).**\n\nWhen it talks about “The flesh” here, it’s not talking about our bodies.  It’s not talking about our skin and muscles.  It’s talking about the desires that all of us have to sin.  \n\nEveryone of us struggles with the flesh - with the desire to sin.  Every one os us.  Every one of us has times where we would rather sleep in than go to church.  Every one of us struggles with anger, fear, lust, bitterness, resentment, laziness.  All of us have that in us. \n\nLost or saved.  You have a flesh.\n\n**When we trust Christ as our savior, we are born again and we get new part inside of us, the Spirit.**\n\n* Jesus said in John 3 *”that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”*  \n* Ephesians 2:1 says *”And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;”*.   \n* Romans 8:9 says *”But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”*\n\n\nWhen you trust Christ, God does a work in you and the Holy Spirit moves in.  You become spiritually alive.  And now it’s not just the flesh anymore.  The flesh has a roommate - the Holy Spirit.\n\nAnd the point of verse 17 is…\n\n**The Spirit and the Flesh are constantly battling with each other inside of us to see who will win.**. \n\nThere is a struggle going on inside me right now.  There is a struggle going on inside you.  It’s a battle.  It’s a wrestling match.  It never ends until we get to heaven.\n\nWe have this flesh - this part of us that desires to do sinful stuff and now we have the Spirit that wants to lead us to do right and they are fighting out a turf war in our hearts all the time.  It’s a struggle.\n\nTurn with me real quick to Romans 7.  Romans 7 verse 18.  This is Paul talking about this struggle in his own life.  Look at it…\n\n> *”For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.”*\n\nNow skip down to verse 22:\n\n> *”For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.  O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?”*\n\nThat’s a struggle.  Listen - if the apostle Paul had this struggle - you are going to have it too. It’s part of being a human being.\n\nIt’s almost a little bit like being married.  You know, when you are a Batchelor, you can leave your shoes and your clothes wherever you want and nobody cares.  You can drink from the milk carton.  Leave the toilet seat up.  No one is going to fuss at you.  But then you get married and now their is a struggle.  \n\nMaybe that’s a bad illustration.  But the point is that before you got saved, you probably could live in the flesh and it not bother you.  Your sin didn’t trouble you that much.  But when the Holy Spirit moves in all of a sudden their is this struggle and you feel miserable when you sin.\n\nBecause the spirit and the flesh are polar opposites.  They never are going in the same direction.  They are always fighting against each other.\n\nSo the concept - we are to live in the spirit, the conflict - we have these two warring factions in our heart.  Let me quickly give you a third point…\n\n\n# 3. The course of action\nHow do we “walk in the spirit”?  Next week we are going to look at the works of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit and get into this more, but I want to leave you with two really simple truths for how to walk in the Spirit and have the Spirit win this conflict in your life.\n\nThe first one is this:\n\n## A. Feed the spirit, starve the flesh.\n\nThere is an old story about an Indian man that got saved and came up to the preacher several weeks later and said “Preacher, I’m doing terrible.  Now that I’m saved, it’s like there are two dogs inside of me - the old dog and the new dog - and they are just a fighting.”  \n\nAnd the preacher asked the Indian “Well, which dog is winning?”  And the Indian said “The dog I feed the most.”\n\nIf you want to walk in the Spirit, you have to feed the spirit and starve the flesh.\n\nRemember, the flesh isn’t referring to our skin and bones here but our sinful nature.  I’m not saying you should starve yourself and not eat here.  \n\nBut there are things that appeal to our spirit and there are things that appeal to our sinful nature.\n\nListen, some music is going to feed your spirit and some music is going to feed your flesh.  If you live on a constant diet of music that feeds your flesh - you flesh is going to be strong and winning the battle in your life.\n\nThere are friends who feed your spirit and friends who feed your flesh.  There are books that feed your spirit and books that feed your flesh.  There are entertainment choices that feed your flesh.  I could go on and on.\n\nBut being in church and worshipping - that feeds your spirit.  Studying your Bible - that feeds your spirit.  Singing and listening to Christ-honoring music that feeds your spirit. \n\nSo feed the Spirit and starve the flesh.\n\nListen, let me get right down to it.  Some of you are never going to have spiritual victory until you get rid of some of your carnal movies or carnal music or carnal books.  \n\n* Devotions and Metallica don’t go together.  (Or Eminem or \n* Church and pornography don’t go together.  \n* Living for Jesus and 50 Shades of Grey don’t go together.  \n* Having a Christian family and feeding your mind with Family Guy don’t go together.\n\nYou’ve got to feed one and starve the other.\n\nSo feed the spirit, starve the flesh.  One more thing you have to do is…\n\n## B. Heed the spirit, ignore the flesh.\n\nBoth the Spirit and the flesh are giving you directions.  You have to listen to one or the other.  \n\nEver been driving with the GPS on and someone giving you conflicting directions at the same time.  You have to listen to one and ignore the other.\n\nThe Spirit will speak to you through prayer, through reading the Bible, through going to church, through regular impulses and through your conscience.  You have to listen to the spirit and obey it.\n\nYour flesh is going to be speaking to you too.  You have to learn to ignore it.  \n\n\n",

    "body": "We are in the middle of a weird section in Acts. It’s kind of difficult for a preacher. You see, Acts is a historical book. It just is giving us the history of the early church. And as a historical book - sometimes it just records details for us and we are like “what do we do with that?”\n\nAt first glance - it would seem like our passage this morning is like that. Lots of little seemingly unconnected details. A lot of “what do we do with this?” kind of stuff. But I think as we look at this there is a lot we can learn from this passage of scripture and I’m excited about showing that to you this morning.\n\nLet’s start by reading the text. Acts 20:1-12\n\n”And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece, And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia. And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. These going before tarried for us at Troas. And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days. And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight. And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together. And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead. And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him. When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed. And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.”\n\nSo this story, it’s interesting. I mean, you have a teenager falling asleep in a church service and falling out of a window and dying and then being miraculously healed. That’s interesting. It’s memorable.\n\nBut what does it teach us?\n\nThe first couple verses tell us about Paul’s travels - but again- what does it teach us? What do WE do with it?\n\nI want to ask you a question this morning that I think this passage answers as well as anything in the new testament. That question is “What is a normal church?” or “What does a normal church look like?”\n\nThere are two ways to use the word “normal.” One way is “like everyone else.” In that sense - we don’t want to be a normal church. The other way is “the way things should be.” That’s what we are getting at this morning.\n\nThere are all kinds of churches aren’t there. You’ve got the super traditional presbyterian type churches. The loud and proud charismatic churches. The modern hip theatre churches. There are churches that meet in coffee houses and just have a “conversation.” But my question is - what is a normal church supposed to be like?\n\nAs believers - we cannot define that on our own. We have to look to the Bible.\n\nBut amazingly - there aren’t a lot of passages that describe the day to day life and ministry of the churches in the New Testament. But there is one here. You see, this passage might not have an OBVIOUS application for us - but it does have an application. Definitely. This passage gives us a glimpse into the life of the early church and we can see in this passage what a normal church should look like.\n\nSo I’m going to give you five things and I’ll explain the passage as we go along.\n\nFirst,\n\n1. A normal church is a loving church. (1)\nLet me show you where we see that. Look at verse 1.\n\n”And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.”\n\nPaul is in Corinth. Remember, they have just had this riot there. Paul’s been there for awhile. Now it’s time for him to leave and notice what it says he did. He called the disciples - that’s all of the Christians in the church at Corinth - and he embraced them. He gave them each a hug.\n\nCan I tell you that when you look at the church in the New Testament, you see an affectionate church. They loved each other and they weren’t afraid to show it.\n\nThis is all over the New Testament. Paul said in Romans 16:16\n\n”Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.”\n\n(I once saw that verse on the back of a church van in town, kind of thought that was strange.)\n\nBut listen, they weren’t afraid to show physical affection one for another in the New Testament.\n\nMany times Jesus had people showing physical affection to Him. Whether it was John leaning on his breast at the Last Supper or the woman who broke the alabaster box on his head and kissed His feet over and over.\n\nNow, what does that teach us?\n\nFirst, I think it teaches us that Paul wasn’t some standoffish overly elevated man who never had anything to do with the people. He loved the people. He let them touch him. Jesus let his followers touch him and show Him affection.\n\nListen, that’s a comfort. It’s ok to love on Jesus. It’s ok to show Jesus affection. He’ll love on you back. It’s ok.\n\nBut I think the main thing we see from this is that we ought to show each other we love one another. This ought to be a part of the church. This is what normal church looks like.\n\nI absolutely despise this idea of church where it’s just a place we come on sunday to watch a show. No! It’s a family. It’s a body. It ought to be obvious to outsiders that we love each other and we ought not to be afraid to say “I love you” or even to give a brother a hug.\n\nListen - I struggle with this. I’m as bad about this as anybody out there. So people show affection freely - I’m not one of them. I have to work at it. But affection should be a part of the the church.\n\nThat’s normal.\n\nThe second thing we see about the church is:\n\n2. A normal church is a giving church. (2)\nYou are probably looking at this passage and thinking: “Ok, pastor - where do you get that?”\n\nWell look at verses 1-2 again:\n\n”And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia. And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece”\n\n“Ok, Pastor - still not seeing giving.”\n\nYou are right. If you just read this on the surface there isn’t much about giving. But if you take the rest of the New Testament and the letters that Paul wrote about this time and you put the pieces together. You realize WHY Paul went to Macedonia. He went their to collect an offering.\n\nIn Romans 15:25-26 it says:\n\n”[Rom 15:25-26 KJV] 25 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints. 26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.”\n\nPaul is saying “I’m headed to Macedonia and Achaia to take up a collection. Achaia was another name for Greece. This is talking about this passage. It’s also mentioned in 1 Corinthians 16 and in 2 Corinthians 8.\n\nSo, what was the offering for? It was for “the poor saints which were at Jerusalem.” These early church Christians were giving enough to give generously for a bunch of people they probably didn’t know and would never see.\n\nThis was a big deal. There was a lot of logistics involved. You couldn’t just send it via PayPal. You had to have an entourage. Protection. You had to take a long and perilous journey.\n\nLet me tell you - a normal church is a giving church. It’s a church that gives to causes bigger than itself. In this story it was poor believers in Jerusalem. Today it might be missionaries. It might be some cause in a foreign land. It might be a church that loses everything in a flood. It might be poor people in the church or in the community. But if we are going to be a normal church according to the New Testament we have to be giving to causes bigger than ourselves.\n\nSo a normal church is a giving church.\n\nTo find the third thing you have to skip down a bit. In verses 3-6 it tells about Paul’s plans to sail to Jerusalem, but some people were probably planning to off him on the boat and God tips him in on this so he goes another way. He stops in a city called Troas and while he is there he meets with the church there.\n\nNow, look at verse 7. Verse 7 is where we are going to get the rest of our things.\n\n”And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.”\n\nEver wonder what a first century early church actually did. What a normal church looks like. The third thing:\n\n3. A normal church is a committed worshipping church (7)\nIt says they meet “on the first day of the week.” They met on Sunday. Saturday was the sabbath for the jews. Sunday is the Lord’s day for Christians. They were committed to worshipping God together on the first day of the week.\n\nPaul writes about this in that passage I mentioned before in 1 Cor. 16. He says “take up your offering on the first day of the week” That’s when Christians met together.\n\nListen folks - we are missing that today. For too many people, attending church on Sunday is optional. I’m not talking 3 times a week like many people do - I’m talking Sunday. Everything else takes precedence. Vacation. Sports. Their hobby. Everything.\n\nSunday is the Lord’s day. Listen - I’m a triathlete. I swim and run and ride my bike and I love it. There is a race in town today. All of my triathlete friends are racing it. I’m in shape. I’d do really well. I’d love to be in that race. But listen folks - it’s not the day for racing. It’s Sunday. It’s the Lord’s day.\n\nNow, listen, I’m not saying it’s wrong to do anything else on Sunday. What I am saying is that Sunday should be special. It should be the Lord’s day and that meeting together with believers on this day should take precedence.\n\nWe see how much precedence it took in this passage. These people didn’t live in a day and age where you got Sunday off. Christianity was new. Many were probably slaves or servants. They were expected to work on Sunday. So they met together at night after work and they stayed together all night long worshipping God.\n\nThey were committed. After slaving. After working. Knowing they had to work the next day. They still met together for worship on the first day of the week.\n\nLook at the fourth thing:\n\n4. A normal church is an ordinance practicing church (7)\nIt says “the disciples came together to break bread.” We know that the early church did two things together almost every time they met. They had what was called “the love feast” which was just a fellowship meal. It was like a potluck. But after the love feast they would take the Lord’s supper. That’s what is mentioned here.\n\nThere are two ordinances that we believe in. They are ordinances. They aren’t sacraments. They don’t save. They teach. We are commanded to do them. They are the Lord’s Supper and Believers Baptism.\n\nThey are both pictures. Object lessons that teach us about Christ and what He has done for us and we are commanded to do each of them.\n\nThe early church took the Lord’s supper so seriously that apparently they did it every Sunday night.\n\nSo a normal church practices the ordinances.\n\nOne more thing and we’ll be done. You knew I was going to go here:\n\n5. A normal church is a bible preaching church (7)\nThe last part of verse 7 says:\n\n”Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.”\n\nThese people didn’t just get together for a potluck. They got together after a hard days work at the biggest house they could find, they settled onto the third floor where it was open and flat, and they listened to preaching. Paul preached the Bible to them. Time wise - this is the biggest thing we see here.\n\nI mean, it says he preached until midnight. Then it tells the story of this boy Eutychus, who was probably just a young teenager, falling asleep and then falling out the third story window. (They didn’t put glass in windows so at most there would have just been a shutter.)\n\nThe boy dies. That will wake you up. That will make for a memorable church service. He dies and Paul miraculously heals him. Look at verse 10:\n\n”And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.”\n\nIt’s kind of a confusing sentence construction but most commentators think that there is a miracle here. That the boy actually died and Paul, much like Jesus and Elijah when they rose people from the dead, comforted people by saying “he’s just sleeping” or in this case “his life is in him” and then healed him.\n\nBut look what verse 11 says:\n\n”When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.”\n\nThis could mean two things: either Paul just had a long conversation with people or he went back to preaching. In either case - this early church got together to hear preaching. And it was LONG preaching.\n\nI try really hard to be deliberate with my preaching. It don’t think of it as 30 minutes of time. I think of it as 30 minutes times as many people as are here. So I try to know exactly what I’m going to say and to make it interesting. Sometimes I’m more successful than other times. I know the old addage that says “the head can only absorb what the seat can endure.” Ok.\n\nBut I also know this. There are a whole lot of people who don’t want to hear preaching and a whole lot of churches that accommodate that with very short token sermons.\n\nListen folks, we don’t come to leave. We come to worship and listen to the word of God. And it’s not something we just made up - it’s what churches have been doing since the beginning.\n\nI want to close by reading something to you. This was written by a man named Justin Martyr in AD 150 - besides the Bible, it’s the earliest description of what the early church did. I just want to read one paragraph:\n\nAnd we afterwards continually remind each other of these things. And the wealthy among us help the needy; and we always keep together; and for all things wherewith we are supplied, we bless the Maker of all through His Son Jesus Christ, and through the Holy Ghost. And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place, and the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read, as long as time permits; then, when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs, and exhorts to the imitation of these good things. Then we all rise together and pray, and, as we before said, when our prayer is ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president in like manner offers prayers and thanksgivings, according to his ability, and the people assent, saying Amen; and there is a distribution to each, and a participation of that over which thanks have been given, and to those who are absent a portion is sent by the deacons. And they who are well to do, and willing, give what each thinks fit; and what is collected is deposited with the president, who succours the orphans and widows and those who, through sickness or any other cause, are in want, and those who are in bonds and the strangers sojourning among us, and in a word takes care of all who are in need. But Sunday is the day on which we all hold our common assembly, because it is the first day on which God, having wrought a change in the darkness and matter, made the world; and Jesus Christ our Saviour on the same day rose from the dead. For He was crucified on the day before that of Saturn (Saturday); and on the day after that of Saturn, which is the day of the Sun, having appeared to His apostles and disciples, He taught them these things, which we have submitted to you also for your consideration.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSo, here is the questions I want you to ask this morning. Not “are we a normal church” but “are you a normal church member?”\n\nDo you have a genuine love for your brothers and sisters in Christ?\n\nJesus said in John 13:35 “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.”\n\nDo you love the brethren?\n\nAre you a giving Christian? Do you see the needs of those around you and give to help them?\n\nAre you committed to coming together for worship? What does it take you to miss church? Is Sunday special or just another day?\nDo you practice the ordinances? Have you been baptized after salvation? Do you partake in the Lord’s Supper when we have it?\nDo you love Bible preaching?\nThis aren’t arbitrary things. They are what churches have done from the beginning.",

    "body": "Tonight we are going to go back to the book of Acts.  It's a basic message - really simple.  But I think it's practical.  I think it's something we need to know.\n\nI'm going to let Adam continue in Genesis while I am gone.\n\nLet's read Acts 14:21-28.\n\n> *\"And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting then to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation aenter into the Kingdom of God.  And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom thy believed.  And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.  And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia: And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.  And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.  And there they abode long time with the disciples.\"*\n\n\nThis passage is a kind of summary passage.  It tells us that Paul went to a few other places and then went back and visited the places where they had preached.  It's Paul and Barnabas's missionary journey in reverse.\n\nBut here is the idea, the one idea that you get from these verses - everywhere that Paul went - he left a church.\n\nIn fact, Paul wrote one of the books of the Bible - Galatians, right after this to these people.  Turn with me to Galatians 1.  Hold your finger here and then go there.\n\nLook at verses 1-2:\n\n> *\"Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia\"*\n\nNotice that last phrase of verse 2: *\"To the churches of Galatia\"**\n\nEverywhere Paul has been would be considered \"Galatia\" and he was only in these places for a short time - just a few weeks or a few months - but he left behind churches.\n\nEver read \"Hansel and Gretel\" - you know how as they journeyed through the woods they left breadcrumbs.  Paul is journeying through the whole world and he's dropping churches everywhere he goes.\n\nNow, that should tell you something - and I think we'll make this our first point:\n\n## Christians need church\n\nChurch isn't some something that was made up to take up everyone's time. It's not an optional part of the Christian life.  Paul went around and preached the gospel, and as soon as he had converts he organized churches.  And when he went back through he wasn't visiting individual converts he was visiting individual churches.\n\nYou know, there are some people who think that the church is some kind of social club.  Or that the church is some optional add-on to the Christian life.  They want to buy the whole Christ thing, but they don't want to add the church package - because they don't want to make the weekly payments.  That's not how this works. \n\nSo that's the first thing I want you to see.  That Paul left churches because Christians need churches.\n\nIt's not a perfect analogy and I realize it - but it's mostly true.  You play baseball in the context of a field.  You are an astronaut in the context of outer space.  You live the Christian life in the context of a local church. \n\nSo Paul left all of these churches.  Ok.\n\nAll right, so I want you to think about this for a minute.  It's Ad 45 or something like that.  There are all of these baby churches that have only had Paul with them for a short time. In many cases Paul had to leave them early because of persecution. They are spread out all over the place and can't really fellowship with each other.\n\nThat's kind of a scary spot don't you think.  I mean - these churches are babies.  If I were to take Noah tomorrow and just leave him somewhere along the interstate in central Ohio to fend for himself - that would concern you wouldn't it?  That's almost what was going on with these churches - they were at best toddlers and they were being left to fend for themselves.\n\nSo we know that Christians need churches - what do churches need?\n\nThat's why I wanted to preach on this passage because it gives us three things - three tools that the church has at it's disposal.  \n\nLook again at our passage.  Verses 22-23 give us a kind of overview of how Paul handled these baby churches and what he trusted.  Look at those verses again:\n\n> *\"Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed\"*\n\nOk, so here is my main point tonight.  My main point is that Paul could leave these churches as baby churches because they had three things.  These are the three things that churches need to stay healthy. They are three things that modern established churches need too.  Ready:\n\nThe first thing churches need is...\n\n## Apostolic Teaching (The Scriptures)\n\nPaul was an apostle, and as an apostle he gave guidance to the early church.  He went about confirming and exhorting the people.  He told them to continue in the faith - which refers to the teaching he gave them.  They needed his guidance.\n\nNow - you might be thinking - Pastor, we don't have apostles today. We don't have someone giving us this kind of apostolic teaching.  You are right.  We don't.\n\nBut we still have access to apostolic teaching.  Apostolic instruction for the church.  Do you know what we have?  Every book of the New Testament is recorded apostolic teaching.  We are reading apostolic teaching now.\n\nListen - the first thing that churches need is the Bible.  They need the New TEstament.  They need to be Bible churches.\n\nWhen Paul wrote a letter to an early pastor - his instruction was clear \"Preach the word.\"  More than programs, more than nice buildings, more than technology - more than any of that what churches need is the Bible.  They need the Bible.\n\nLook - there are much more exciting ways to speak to you than going through the Bible like we do here.  I could make up themes and topics - I do sometimes - and we could have a steady diet of just that and we could really ramp it up.  Or we could bring in some dynamic guy to get everyone jazzed up every week with funny stories.  But the main reason we don't do that, other than I just couldn't pull it off, is because that isn't what you need.  You need the scriptures.\n\nThere are a lot of churches today that I think have gone to the point of license.  They have nothing about them that identifies them as believers.  They live and act just like the world around them.  I don't think that's a good thing.  Do you know what they need?  They need the Bible.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are churches that are legalistic.  They are all about the rules.  They've got rules for everything. I was listening to a video the other day and the pastor was just going on and on about rules for this and rules for that.  I don't think that's how God intended them to live the Christian life.  But do you know what they need - they need the Bible.\n\n1 Peter 2:2\n\n> *\"As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby\"*\n\nPeople need the Lord but people need the word.  That's how Christians grow.\n\nSo these churches had apostolic teaching and we have apostolic teaching.\n\nThe second thing these churches had was...\n\n## Elder Oversight (The Pastorate)\n\nNotice what the text says:\n\n> *\"And when they had ordained them elders in every church\"*\n\nThe second thing that Paul could trust as he left these baby churches alone was what this passage calls \"elders.\"  But these aren't \"elders\" in the sense that they are old.  You don't have to be ordained to be an old person.  These are the pastoral leadership of the church.  Sometimes they are called \"elders\", sometimes they are called \"bishops\", sometimes they are called \"pastors.\"  It's the same group of men, and actually, elder is the most common name in the New Testament. \n\nTurn with me to the book of Titus.  Titus 1. Look at verse 5:\n\n> *\"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee\"*\n\nThis is a common thing.  They would start a church and immediately they would ordain the leadership of the church. The elders.  \n\nTurn to 1 Peter 5.  With me.  We'll look at verses 1-3:\n\n> *\"The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away\"*\n\nSo we get a clearer picture of who these guys were.  They were the undershepherds.  They were to feed the flock.  They were to take oversight.  They were to lead by example.  They were pastors.\n\nListen, this is going to sound totally egotistical but I don't mean it to be.  Because I'm not indespesible as your pastor.  Ok.  But here this:  A church isn't a healthy church unless its:\n\n1- A Bible led church\n2- An elder led church\n\nThose are two safeguards and provisions God has given to the church.  The Bible and pastors.  So if a church is going to be healthy they need the Bible and pastors.\n\n---\n\nBut there is one more thing.  Look at verse 23 in our text one more time:\n\n> *\"they commended them to the Lord, on whom thy believed.\"*\n\nSo how could Paul just leave these baby churches?  They had Apostolic teaching - they had the Bible.  They had Pastoral leadership.  But there was one more thing they had, and it's something we overlook.  They had:\n\n## Divine Faithfulness (The Holy Ghost)\n\nListen to me.  Here this.  Please hear this.  God loves Bible Baptist church far more than I ever could.  Far, far more.\n\nEphesians 5:25 says:\n\n> *\"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it\"*\n\nJesus loves the church.  If what we have here is a true church - God is going to look out for it.  God is going to take care of it.\n\nOne of the most arrogant things I hear pastors say from time to time is \"This church needs me - I don't know what would happen to this church without me.\"  Ok - I get where they are coming from. Churches do need pastoral leadership - but God cares more about that church if it's a true church than that pastor ever could and God is looking out for it.\n\nChurches, if they are made up of believers, are made up of people who have the Holy Ghost living inside of them - and God will lead them.",

    "body": "# James 4:4-5 - What Is Worldliness?\n\n> *”(4) Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God. (5) Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?” (Jas 4:4-5 KJV)*\n\n\n# Definition\n> Worldliness is living for the same stuff as the lost world around us.\n\n## 1. The world cannot mean the earth - God created that and called it good.\n\n## 2. The world is defined by what it wants:\n\n> *”Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.  For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.  And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.”*  (1 John 2:15-17)\n\nThe world wants to do things (Experience), have things (Possessions), and be things (Status).  \n\n## 3. When you trust Christ, you change.\n* Your **categorization** changes.  You change teams.  You go from being someone who belongs to Satan to being someone who belongs to God.\n> *”Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:”* (Colossians 1:13)\n\n> *”Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;”* (1 Peter 1:21)\n\n* Your **nature** changes.  You go from being darkness to being light; from being the corruption to being the preservative.  \t\n> *”Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.  Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.”* (Matthew 5:13-14)\n* Your **affections** and **desires** change. You have new desires and new motivations.\n> *”And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.”* (Galatians 5:24-25)\t\n\n## 4. Lost people can’t be worldly. \n\nWorldly means “like the world,” and lost people ARE the world.  Just like water can’t be like water or air can’t be like air.  You can’t be like the lost world if you are the lost world.\n\nSo accusing lost people of being worldly is pretty silly.  It’s like accusing a dog of being a dog.  So what?  What do you expect?\n\nLost people are going to live for the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.  That’s all they have.  Expecting otherwise of them doesn’t make sense.\n\n## 5. When the motivating force of a believer’s life is experience, possessions, and status, and not the will of God, they are worldly.\nIt has nothing to do with what you wear or what you do.  It has everything to do with your motivation.\n\nWorldliness isn’t wearing short shorts or having tattoos.  Those might be symptoms of worldliness, but you can be just as worldly in a modest dress or a three-piece suit.  You can be very religious looking and still be worldly.  The Pharisees were worldly.\n\nBut at the same time, when Christians do certain things, it makes no sense outside of worldliness.  Why would you dress in a way to show off your body if you weren’t either:\n1. Trying to be like everyone else, or \n2. Trying to get attention God doesn’t want you to have?\n\nSometimes our actions betray our motivations.  \n\nBut you could say the same thing about the man who spend $1500 on a suit and $1000 on a watch or for the person who spends $80,000 on a car.  Why are you dressing to show off?  That decision makes no sense unless you are living for experience, possessions, and status.\n\n## 6. When a Christian is worldly, it is a grave thing in God’s eyes\n\n### A. It is an act of spiritual adultery.  \n\n> *”Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? ”*\n\n\n### B. It is an act of spiritual treason\n\n> *”whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.”*\n\n\n## 7. Envy is a sure sign of worldly motivation.\n\n> *”Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?”* (James 4:5)\n\n> *”Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.”* (Romans 6:6)",

    "body": "We have heard a lot this election season about \"elites.\" It seems like the story of the election has been \"The people are revolting against the elites.\" In the democratic party - that was the narrative that explained the Bernie Sanders campaign and of course, in the Republican party - that's the narrative that they say explains the rise of Donald Trump. It seems like you cannot turn on talk radio or cable news show without hearing the term \"elite\" get mentioned.\n\nWho are these elites? They are the educated people. The people who went to the best schools. The people who have money and the influence that goes with money. Amanda and I had supper in Effingham on Friday night at the wood fired pizza place downtown and there was a table of people next to us loudly discussing the merits of different wines they'd tasted in different parts of France. That's the elites.\n\nThe upper crust. The self-important.\n\nThe elites are the cultural movers and shakers in our country. They run the news. They run Hollywood. They run the publishing houses. They put out the art. They curate the restaurants. They shape the culture and they know it.\n\nIn our passage this morning - the apostle Paul goes to ground zero for the elites of his day. He goes to the famous ancient city of Athens. And the question I want us to ask and answer this morning is: \"What do the elites need to hear?\" I think we'll find an answer here. I also think we'll find out that the problem of the \"elites\" isn't that much different than our problem.\n\nLet's read the second half of Acts 17 and then we'll jump into it.\n\n\"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry. Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him. Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection. And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is? For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean. (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)\"\n\n\"Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, to the unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man's device. And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.\"\n\n\"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter. So Paul departed from among them. Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.\"\n\nMy outline is really simple. Three points: what paul saw, what paul said, how paul said it.\n\nLet's jump in first with:\n\n1. What Paul Saw\nPaul has come in this story to one of the greatest cities of the ancient world: Athens. Athens was the educational and cultural center of the world and had been for hundreds of years. It was the New York City of it's day. It was where all the important stuff was. It was a ridiculously important town.\n\nSo, let's look at...\n\nWhat His Eyes Saw\nHis eyes would have seen something like this:\n\n\n\nAthens was home to the greatest philosophers of all time. Ever heard of Socretes? - born and lived in Athens. Plato? - He set up his famous philosophy school in Athens. Aristotle? - headquarters - Athens.\n\n\n\nIt was the education center. It was the Yale and Harvard of it's day. It was where all the smart people lived.\n\nYou know, Paul was a pretty educated guy himself, in this passage he quotes four different Greek poets, he had to have learned all about the great city Athens.\n\n\n\nIn the center of this impressive city was a mountain called \"the acropolis.\" \"Akro\" is greek for \"high\" and \"polis\" is greek for city. It was this insanely impressive city build up on a hill so everywhere you looked you saw it's impressive buildings.\n\nWhen I was in college, my family met us in Nashville to do some site seeing and we visited a replica of one of those buildings - the parthenon - there. Even the replica was incredibly impressive and awe inspiring. Someday I'm going to go see the real thing.\n\n\n\nBut let's talk about this acropolis for a minute because it kind of tells us a lot about the city of Athens. You see, the Parthenon wasn't just a pretty building that was put there to be impressive. It was a temple. It was a temple to the Greek goddess Athena. In the middle of the temple was this massive statue to Athena - who was the goddess of war, wisdom and crafts.\n\n\n\nSo that was the Parthenon. But if you look at the rest of the Acropolis, you realize what the purpose of the Acropolis was - you see, it wasn't just the temple to Athena there. There were actually like 7 other temples there to different gods and goddesses. Nike - the goddess of victory. (By the way, that's where the shoe company gets it's name - Phil Knight visited there when he was backpacking around the world as a hippy.) Zeus. Apollo. Augustus. It was this magnificent and impressive tribute to idolatry.\n\nSo that brings me back to what Paul saw. You see, his eyes saw this impressive place, but let's see...\n\nWhat His Heart Saw\nvs. 16 says:\n\n\"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.\"\n\nPaul saw a city that was \"wholly given to idolatry.\"\n\nHe wasn't the only person to say this about Athens. A historian of the time said there were more gods in Athens then there were people. It was an idolatrous place.\n\nNow, I want to talk about \"idolatry\" for a minute. We here in America tend to look at places like Ancient Greece with all their idolatry and we tend to think: \"What a bunch of morons. What a bunch of Neanderthals. Who in the world would worship gods that are made out of wood and stone?\"\n\nAnd if you think like that (I know I have in the past) you are totally missing what this kind of idolatry was.\n\nYou see - they weren't worshiping these gods as gods. It was much more subtle than that. They were worshiping what these gods represented. And what these god's represented was human achievement, they represented happiness without the one true God.\n\nI was in Menards the other day. (Sorry Chuck) and an old song from Fleetwood Mac came on the radio. I'm not endorsing Fleetwood Mac - but most of you have probably heard the song \"Landslide\" right? It's a very memorable song. In the middle of the song, Stevie Nix asks this question:\n\nO mirror in the sky, what is love?\n\nDid you catch that? Did you catch what that song is saying? She says \"O mirror in the sky.\" Let me tell you something about most people. Most people aren't worshiping the one true God. Even if they call themselves Christians. They are worshiping \"the mirror in the sky.\" They are worshiping a reflection of themselves.\n\nTim Keller gives this definition of idolatry. He says idolatry is:\n\nIdolatry is not simply ritual worship, but a whole sensibility and pattern of life based on making particular finite values and created things into god-like absolutes.\n\nIn other words - idols are a reflection of your values and aspirations. We still have idols in America today - we are just a little bit more subtle about them. We don't build giant statues of them - we put them on giant buildboards. We don't have the Temple of Athena Nike - we have Soldier Field. We don't have to go to Athens to worship our gods - we can get them in the New York Times or at Harvard or on the TV.\n\nYou might be saying - not me. Not me. Let me ask you a couple of questions before you get high and mighty:\n\nWhat do you think about when no one is around and you have a few minutes of solitude? Do your thoughts go to a bigger house, to a bigger bank account, to some romance you want?\n\nWilliam Temple said:\n\n\"Your religion is what you do with your solitude.\"\n\nIf there is something your mind constantly goes to - it's probably an idol.\n\nHere's another question: What do you spend your free time and money on? If you are overspending on something - like your house or your car or your boat - it's probably because that thing aligns with an idol of your heart.\n\nHere is one more question for you: What makes you angry? When you don't get something and you fly off the handle. When you can't live without something - that something is probably an idol in your life.\n\nSo back to Athens. Athens was no different than New York or Chicago or anywhere else. It was a big beacon that said \"you can do it\", \"you can go your own way\", \"you can be happy and successful without God.\"\n\nSo what did Paul see at Athens - he saw that the problem of the elites is the same problem as everyone else - they are trying to make it without God.\n\nLet's look secondly at:\n\n2. What Paul Said (18)\nPaul didn't just idlely look on. He did something about it. He spoke up. He had a message for the elites at Athens. It's found at the end of verse 18.\n\n\"because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.\"\n\nPaul looked at the idolatry of Athens and brought the exact same message he brought to the jews at Thessalonica and Berea and everywhere else. He told them about the person of Jesus Christ. He told them about the one who lived a perfect life for them and who died on the cross for them and who rose again for them. He preached to them the message of salvation.\n\nDo you know what the elites need? They need the same gospel as the truck drivers and the coal miners. They need Jesus.\n\nPaul talked about this in 1 Corinthians 1. Turn there and look at verses 18-25:\n\n\"For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.\"\n\n\"Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.\"\n\nNotice - the Jews didn't want the gospel because they were looking for a sign. The Greeks didn't want the gospel because it's too simple for them. But both groups - and everyone in between will only be saved by one thing: by believing the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nLook at our world today. THere are plenty of people who are trying to save themselves with religion like the Jews. They are going to miss it. There are plenty of people who are trying to save themselves with education and accomplishment like the Greeks - they are going to miss it. The only message that saves people is the message of Christ.\n\nThere is one more thing I want you to look at and it's...\n\n3. How Paul Said It\nIn this passage, Paul is preaching in Athens and they bring him to a place called the Areopagus. It was this big rock next to the Acropolis where they had religious trials. They were putting Paul on trial here.\n\nI wish I could go into a lot more detail about the groups that brought him there: the stoics and the epicureans, but we don't have time. A really basic overview would be that the stoics were the under armour people - their motto was \"rule yourself\" and the epicureans were the \"life is good\" people. The stoics saw life as something to be endured, the epicureans saw life as something to be enjoyed. But both of these groups had a problem with Paul's message.\n\nSo Paul is given this opportunity to defend himself and what he is teaching to these very sophisticated philosophical leaders. Notice what he does:\n\nA. He seized the opportunity.\nHe jumps right in and starts preaching the gospel to them. But he presents it a little differently. He says that he saw an altar to \"the unknown god\" and so he uses that as his jumping off point. Then when he's preaching, he speaks their language. He references their poems. He quotes three different Greek poets in just a paragraph.\n\nBut listen, he's going to the same place he always went.\n\nB. He clearly presented the gospel.\nIn verses 30-31 Paul says:\n\n\"but now commandeth all men every where to repent: Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.\"\n\nNow, these Greeks didn't know the Old Testament - so Paul didn't preach the Old Testament to them - but He still went right to Christ. Right to Christ's death and resurrection and He told them what they needed to do about it. They needed to repent and believe.\n\nOne more thing about the way he said it and we'll be done:\n\nC. He spoke boldly.\nHe starts with:\n\n\"I perceive that e are in all things too superstitious\" and ends with \"God now commandeth all men everywhere to repent\" and in the middle he presents them a message he had to know many would scoff at.\n\nHe was bold.\n\nDid Paul know some would mock? Sure he did. Did he know some people would think he was a foolish idiot? Obviously. I'm sure it bothered him just like it would bother you.\n\nBut do you know what else Paul knew. He knew that that was the only message that can save the elites - just like it's the only message that can save the non-elites. They needed to hear the gospel.\n\nSo some people mocked it. Some people were polite but didn't accept it. And look at verse 34:\n\n\"Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.\"\n\nEven in this land of elites - some people believed it. They believed the gospel and saw their life changed and we will meet these people in heaven someday.\n\nConclusion",

    "body": "Take your Bibles with me again to the book of Jude.  Tonight we are going to finish up this book and go through verses 14-25.  \n\nRemember, Jude is all about earnestly contending for the faith once delivered to the saints.  It is about standing up for the truth against what this little book describes very vividly: apostasy.\n\nJust because someone claims to be a Christian doesn’t mean that he is.  Churches are filled with apostates, people who have rejected Christ and don’t really believe the Bible but are still pretending.  These people are like Trojan horse terrorists in churches and God is going to judge them.\n\nMost of this book, verses 8-19, do nothing more than describe apostates to us.  We’ve looked at these descriptions in detail.  Tonight we are going to take one more look at one more description of apostates and then we are going to close up this book by finally talking about what we should do about it.\n\nLet’s get started by reading Verses 14-25\n\n> *”[Jde 1:14-25 KJV] 14 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, 15 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard [speeches] which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. 16 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling [words], having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage. 17 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ; 18 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. 19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit. 20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, 21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. 22 And of some have compassion, making a difference: 23 And others save with fear, pulling [them] out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh. 24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present [you] faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy, 25 To the only wise God our Saviour, [be] glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.”*\n\nThis really should be two messages.  Verses 14-19 go together and give us one more description of the apostates and verses 20-25 give us some parting instructions.  The problem is both of these sermons would be really short by themselves so we are going to look at both things tonight.\n\nFirst, let’s look at...\n\n# One last look at apostates\nVerse 14 quotes Enoch, the seventh from Adam.  The book of Genesis tells us about Enoch, but doesn’t give us any of his quotes, so where does this come from?\n\nEnoch actually wrote a book.  It was called “The Book of Enoch.”  And it was very highly regarded by the Jews in the Old Testament and the early Christians.  It’s important that we understand that it wasn’t scripture.  But it was a book that God used to help people and a book that Jude and his audience knew.\n\nSo what did Enoch say in the book of Enoch that Jude quotes?  He said *“Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment up all , and to convince all hat are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”*\n\nEnoch was a preacher!  So what is Jude saying here?  He is just reminding us again that these apostates are headed for God’s judgment.  He did it in verses 5-7 and he does it again here.  They are headed for judgment.\n\nThen in verses 16-19 he gives a final description of these guys.  Five final characteristics to look out for.  To help us remember, I’m starting them all with the letter M. \n\nFirst, they are...\n\n### 1. Murmerers and complainers \n\nVerse 16 says *”These are murmurers, complainers.”*\n\nIn other words, they are whiney critics.  They are nitpickers.  They are constantly complaining.  \n\nWe were talking about murmurers and complainers this morning in Sunday School.  Remember the children of Israel who were dissatisfied with Moses and who were murmuring about him - God sent a bunch of snakes to bite them and give them a deadly disease.  At one point they complained about the manna and God sent them quail but made the quail taste rotten in their mouth.  Another time they murmured and rose up against Moses and God literally sent fire down from heaven to burn them up.\n\nThe lesson is clear - God is not big on murmurers and complainers.\n\nAs patch the Pirate said \n\n> Nobody likes a grumbled, who can’t control his tongue.  Nobody likes a grumbler, however old or young, nobody likes a person who will grumble and complain, nobody likes to hear someone who sounds like their in pain.\n\nBeing a grumbler and a complainer is a characteristic of a apostate.  It isn’t good.  So if you are someone who is always criticizing and grumbling and whining about what God has given you then you need to check yourself because that’s not a sign of godliness.\n\nSo they are murmurers.  Second, they are  \n\n### 2. Moochers (Flatterers)\n\nThe second half of verse 16 says:\n\n> *”and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.”*\n\nI never understood what this phrase meant until I studied it.  It’s simple really, it’s talking about people who mooch up and kiss up to rich, powerful or influential people.\n\nHave you ever met someone who talks completely different around one crowd of people than they do around another?  \n\nOh...I hate this.  As a pastor, sometimes I’ll be talking to someone and they will find out I’m a pastor and immediately they start being very fake and phony and talking very religious and it’s like “Dude, you were just talking cussing and bragging about a party, now there is a pastor isn’t he room  and you are a holy Joe?”\n\nIt’s sad.  Don’t put on airs for people.  Don’t put on a religious air to go to church.  We aren’t a club for moral people we are a clinic for sinners.  Just come as you are.  Be the same on Monday as you are on Sunday.  \n\nDon’t be a moocher.  Don’t be a kiss up.  Don’t flatter people and change your language to score points with people.  Just be who you are.\n\nThe third characteristic of apostates here is that they are...\n\n### 3. Mockers\n\nVerse 18 says *”how they told you there should be mockers in the last time.”*\n\nThese apostates have a tendency to mock true believers.  To make fun of them.\n\n2 Peter uses the same Greek word here but calls them “scoffers” instead of mockers.  The idea is the same, they are people who make fun of those who walk the truth and teach the truth.\n\nThe fourth characteristic is\n\n### 4. Materialists (walk after their own lusts)\n\n3 times in these verses it refers to this.  In verse 16 it says “they walk after their own lists” in verse 19 it calls them “sensual” and in verse 18 it says they walk after their ungodly lusts.\n\nIn each case, I don’t think this is talking about sensuality here in the way we think of it.  I don’t think this is sexual. That’s already been covered.  No I think wheat it is talking about here is that these people don’t live spiritual lives, they live soully lives.    They are dominated by their desires.\n\nThe motto of these people is “if it feels good, do it.”  \n\nLastly, they are...\n\n### 5. Mavericks (they separate themselves)\n\nVerse 19 says “they separate themselves.”  This is interesting.  It’s the only time this particular word is used in the whole New Testament.  The idea seems to be that they think they are too a good for other Christians and so they make up their own little cliques that only they are good enough to belong to.  \n\nSo these are the apostates.  I’ve been talking about them for two months and frankly, I’m tired of talking about them.  So the question is what do we do about them? \n# What we should do about them:\nDo we launch a crusade?  To we have a tribunal and put people out of the church?  Do we walk around suspicious of everyone else in the church?  What are we supposed to do?\n\nActually, the answer isn’t to look after\n\n## 1. Look inward (20-21)\n## 2. Look outward (22-23)\n## 3. Look upward (24-25)",

    "body": "# Ecclesiastes 7:15-29\n\nTake your Bible’s with me and turn to Ecclesiastes 7 again.  We are going to read verse 11 through verse 1 of chapter 8 tonight.\n\nBefore I get into this, I want to tell you that a huge amount of this tonight and next week come from an excellent series by a man from Bob Jones named Jim Berg called *Secrets of the Good Life.*. I own and have read many commentaries on Ecclesiastes and read several in preparation for tonight, but nothing comes close to how helpful Dr. Berg’s series is on this and tonight and next week I’m just about ripping it off.  So you might find it helpful to look that up and meditate on it a bit.\n\nThis chapter - especially this part of the chapter - is about wisdom and what wisdom does for us.\n\nWhat does it mean to have wisdom?  Does being really smart make you have wisdom? We all know people who are very, very intelligent but who aren’t very wise.  You can know a lot and still not have wisdom.\n\nI’d also say that being a good Christian and having good intentions is not necessarily tied to wisdom.  There are a lot of well-meaning Christian people who aren’t very wise.  \n\nBut we are getting ahead of ourselves.  What actually is wisdom?\n\nI would say that wisdom is the skill and practice for making the right decisions.  It is the ability to do what is best next.  What is best right now.  It is an in-the-moment skill.\n\nThe truth is that all it takes is a moment of bad decisions to ruin your life.  King David ruined his testimony and poisoned his family by making one bad decision with Bathsheba.  Ananais and Sapphira were killed because of one bad decision in Acts 5.  How many teenagers have really hurt themselves because of one or two stupid decisions that they have to live with the rest of their lives.  God gives grace - but that doesn’t mean there are no consequences.  How many men have lost their families due to one bad decision?  \n\nWhen it all comes down to it and we meet Jesus, I think the only thing He is going to going to hold us accountable for is our **decisions**.  He’s not going to hold you accountable for your **circumstances**.  He is not going to hold you accountable for your skills or your natural talents.  He is going to hold you accountable for **what you did with** your circumstances and gifts.  For your decisions in the middle of it all. \n\nSo we need wisdom.  One of the illustrations that Dr. Berg gives is the illustration of a traffic jam.  How many of you have ever been in the middle of a bad traffic jam?  You can’t see what is causing the traffic jam and really, that doesn’t matter.  All you can see is what is ahead of you and you can’t control any of the other cars.  You can only control your own car and your own steering wheel.\n\nAnd some people think of wisdom as seeing the end of the thing and understanding it from God’s viewpoint.  That’s kind of like being in the helicopter above the traffic jam and seeing the whole thing.  But the truth is - God doesn’t give you the helicopter view.  99% of the time God just gives you the steering wheel view and he expects you to make the right decisions now based on His word.\n\nSo wisdom isn’t so much focused on “why did this happen to me”. Wisdom says **“O.k., this happened, what does God want me to do NOW.”** And then making that decision.\n\nI think the best example of this in the Bible might be Joseph.  Joseph didn’t get a whole lot of say over his own life.  A lot of really terrible things happened to Joseph that he had no say over.  And Joseph couldn’t see the end.  He had no way of knowing that his trip to see his brothers would end up with him in a pit, and then as a slave and then in a prison.  But what did Joseph do?  He used wisdom.  He served God the best he could in HIS situation and left the rest up to God and God blessed.\n\nAnother example is Daniel.  Daniel is taken from his home and his country and his language and his culture.  He is forced to work for this king who has taken everything from him.  But Daniel didn’t get caught up in the why, Daniel just trusted God and made the best decisions TODAY.  \n\nListen, don’t worry about what God wants you to do five years from now or ten years from now.  Find out what God wants you to do TODAY and make wise decisions TODAY.\n\nLet’s read the text:\n\n# What Wisdom Does For You:\n\n### 1. Wisdom gives you the ability to manage what you have (11)\n*”Wisdom is good with an inheritance”* in other words, even if you are given everything, if you have no wisdom to manage it - you are going to run yourself into the ground.\n\nIllustration: August Busch IV\n### 2. Wisdom gives life (11-12)\n\n*”wisdom giveth life to them that have it.”* \n\n*Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.* (19)\n\n> *”She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.”* (Proverbs 3:18)\n\n> *”For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.”* (Pro. 8:35)\n\n> *”Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.”* (Proverbs 3:13-18)\n\n\n### 3. Wisdom teaches you how to respond to life’s fluctuations (13-14)\n\n> *”[Luk 12:16-20 KJV] 16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully: 17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? 18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, [and] be merry. 20 But God said unto him, [Thou] fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?”*\n\n\n\n### 4. Wisdom allows you to weather life’s injustices: (15-17)\n* By keeping you from self-righteousness *be not righteous over much*\n* By keeping you from self-sufficiency (neither make thyself over wise)\n* By keeping you from self-indulgence (over wicked)\n\n### 4. Wisdom comes from the fear of the Lord (18-19)\n\nWisdom isn’t knowing the overall view, it’s knowing what to do next with the view you have.\n\n\n### 5. Wisdom allows you to see your own faults, not just those of others. (21-22)\n\n> ” Wisdom teaches us not to expect that those we deal with should be faultless; we ourselves are not so, none are so, no, not the best. This wisdom strengthens the wise as much as any thing, and arms them against the danger that arises from provocation” (Matthew Henry)\n\n“ The only cure for self-deception is a lot of time in the word”\n\n> “ Be not solicitous or inquisitive to know what people say of thee; if they speak well of thee, it will feed thy pride, if ill, it will stir up thy passion. See therefore that thou approve thyself to God and thy own conscience, and then heed not what men say of thee.” Matthew Henry\n\n### 6. Wisdom allows you to escape the snares of sin (23-26)\n\n\n\n### 7. Wisdom allows you to see man’s real problem (27-29)\n\nNot many people are wise, they want to go their own way.\n\n\n### 8. Wisdom fundamentally changes a man (8:1)\n- His face brightens\n- His face softens\n\n\n",

    "body": "I won't have a long message for you tonight.  It's not even something you've never heard before.  But I think its something some of you need to hear now. We are just going to look at a Bible story that may or may not be familiar to you and draw from it four simple lessons.\n\nSo turn with me to 1 Samuel 30.  That's right, we'll go to Genesis next week, tonight we are going to 1 Samuel 30.\n\nBefore we read it, a little bit of context:\n\nThis is 1 Samuel 30, for the last 11 chapters of this, David has been running for his life.  Saul is trying to kill him.  For seven years he's been on the run.  It's been a rough seven years.  He's worked for several rival governments as a mercenary.  He's lived in caves and in the woods.  He's been betrayed multiple times.  His first wife has married another woman.  He's a fugitive.\n\nDespite this, he manages to get together a band of followers who fight with him and work with him.  They are in hiding together.\n\nIn the last chapter, David and his men are dismissed by the Philistines.  So he and his men have just been fired.\n\nSo that's the backdrop of this: it's like a country music song.  David has lost everything.  He's lost his job.  He's lost his wife.  He's lost his place in society.  He's been betrayed.  He's on the run.\n\n\nAnd when did all of this start for David?  It started in 1 Samuel 16, when David was just minding his own business and the prophet Samuel called him out of the field and anointed him to one day be king of Israel.  So add to all of this, David has the expectation that some day he's supposed to be king.  It certainly didn't look like there was any way that was going to happen here.\n\nNow, with all of that in mind, let's look at 1 Samuel 30.  Remember, they are on the run, they are on their way back to their camp, they've just been fired.\n\n> *\"And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; And had taken the women captives, that were therein:they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and went on their way\"*\n\n> *\"So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite\"* (1-5)\n\nSo here is what they see when they get back to their camp.  A rival army - the Amalekites, have come in when all of the men where gone and burned their camp and taken all of their families into slavery.\n\nSo imagine this - you are already having a rough time.  You've got to go home to tell your wife that you just lost your job.  And you get home and there is no home.  Home has been burnt down, and someone has taken your wife and your kids captive.  \n\nThat's what David and every one of his men experienced in 1 Samuel 30.  Do you know what we call that?  A really bad day.\n\nBut it gets worse.  Look at verse 6\n\n> *\"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters\"*\n\nSo now, not only is David heartbroken, but the only thing he has left - his men - are wanting to kill him.\n\nThis is what you call a really, really bad day. This is some stinky circumstances.\n\nMany of you have dealt with some terrible things, but most of you probably have never had to deal with something this bad.  This is a total loss.  This is pretty terrible.\n\nAnd I think we can learn some lessons from this story for when we are going through stinky circumstances.  \n\n**So let's pray and we'll continue to look at this chapter and I'll give you four things we can learn from this:**\n\nSo four lessons from this chapter.  The first lesson is this:\n\n## 1. When our circumstances stink, God is still in control.\n\nCould we agree that David was at a low point in his life and that he was dealing with some pretty bad circumstances here? Of course he was. \n\nDavid wasn't on the throne.  He didn't have a friend in the world here.  His band of followers had turned against him.  Everything looked as bleak as could be.  But God was still on the throne.\n\n\nIt reminds me of a song we used to sing:\n\n```\nGod is still on the throne, and He will remember his own.\nHis promise is true, He will not forget you.\nGod is still on the throne.\n```\n\n\nGod was still in charge.  Romans 8:28 hadn't been written yet, but God was still working all things together for good.\n\nCan I tell you with certainty - no matter how bad your circumstances - God's still in charge.  \n\n* No matter how bleak it may seem here - God is still in charge.  \n* No matter who is in the white house - God is still in charge.  \n* No matter how much you have in the bank account - God is still in charge.  \n* No matter what the doctor says - God is still in charge.\n\nHe's still on the throne.\n\nSo, when circumstances stink - remember that God is still in control.\n\n---\n\nTo understand the second lesson, let's keep reading in 1 Samuel 30. Look at verse 6:\n\n> *\"And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters:but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God\"*\n\nSo what did David do?  Verse 6 tells us - *He encouraged himself in the Lord.*\n\nSo here is the second lesson:\n\n## 2. When our circumstances stink, God is still good.\n\nHow could David encourage Himself in the Lord when everything around him was so bad?  Because God is good. God is good all the time.\n\nLet's look at some psalms for a minute.  Let me read you some:\n\n> *\"Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 106:1)\n\n> *\"O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 107:1)\n\n> *\"O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 118:1)\n\n> *\"O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.\"* (Psalm 136:1)\n\n> *\"Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.\"* (Psalm 119:68)\n\nChurch - God is good.\n\nIt's been awhile since we did this but let's do it together tonight.  I'm going to say God is good - you say \"all the time.\"\n\nReady \"God is good\" -\n\"God is good\" -\n\"God is good\" -\n\nPsalm 145:7-9\n\n> *\"[Psa 145:7-9 KJV] 7 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. 8 The LORD [is] gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy. 9 The LORD [is] good to all: and his tender mercies [are] over all his works.\"* \n\nGod is good.  Even when our circumstances aren't good - God is good.  \n\nAnd do you know what - when you can't get any encouragement by looking around - you can always get encouragement by looking up and believing that God is good.\n\nWhen you get the worst news - God is still good and He's still in charge.\n\nIt's really easy to say that when everything is going well - but it's still true when everything is falling to pieces.  God is good.\n\n---\n\nLet's look at the third lesson:\n\n## 3. When our circumstances stink, God is still leading.\n\nBack in 1 Samuel 30 - look what David did next, after David encouraged himself in the Lord, look what He does: (Verse 7)\n\n> *\"And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. And David enquired at the Lord, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue:for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.\"*\n\nIn the Old Testament, one of the things that God led the people with was through the High Priest's ephod.  It was just a vest, and inside of the vest their were these stones and the people would use them to get direction.\n\nSo David is at the bottom of the barrel and what does he do?  He looks for direction from God.  He goes to the ephod and God gives him instructions.\n\nMaybe, and I don't know here, this is just opinion, but maybe God had to put David here before he saught God's guidance.  I don't know - but God was still leading him.\n\nI remember the first time we drover from Mattoon to Terre Haute.  We were following our GPS, and we found ourselves on this gravel road that looked like it was in the middle of the worlds largest corn field.  There was nothing anywhere and we thought \"this must be wrong\"  but there was one thing that comforted us - that thing was still giving us directions and it turned out it was just taking us the shortest way.\n\nSailors have this saying \"Always be tacking.\"  That means no matter how bleak it looks, always be looking for direction and keeping track of where you are.\n\nYou may be in a terrible spot and life might stink.  Keep following God.  Keep tacking.  Seek His direction and His leadership and He'll help you. \n\nLook, I don't know this, but if you are in a place right now where you feel lost and nothing seems to be going your way - maybe just maybe God put you there so you would finally seek direction from Him.  \n\nKeep seeking God.\n\n---\n\nSo David and his men go after the Amalekites and they get their wives and their families back.  But more than that, they get an enormous ammount of spoil that the Amalekites have stolen.  \n\nDavid went from losing it all to getting more than he ever had in one chapter.\n\nDo you know God can do that?  Your circumstances might stink right now - God can turn them around tomorrow. He can do that.  \n\nSo David takes this immense fortune that he's gotten in one day and do you know what he does with it - he sends a little bit of it to all the elders of Judah.  \n\nAnd in the next chapter, King Saul dies in battle.\n\nAnd in the next chapter, David is made king over Judah.  \n\nAnd here's the thing - all of this happened within days of his total loss at Ziklag, and the events at Ziklag were what led to him being king in Judah.\n\nSo what's the point?  Here's the last lesson and we are done:\n\n## 4. When our circumstances stink, God might be about to turn the page.\n\nGod might be using the terrible circumstances that you are going through to do something amazing in your life.  But you'll never know unless you follow Him, unless you look to Him for guidance, unless you choose to believe in God's goodness even when the circumstances make Him look bad.\n\nI think when David looked back on Ziklag - he didn't see a terrible time - he saw an amazing time.  He saw God come through at Ziklag.  He saw that God had been working all along.\n\nSo church - just trust God.  When the circumstances are great - trust God.  When the circumstances are crummy trust God.  He's still in control. He's still good.  He's still leading and He's up to something.\n\nLet's stand for invitation and prayer.",

You let me know at the end if you've figured out what movie this comes from?\n\n```\nCourage! What makes a King out of a slave?\nCourage! What makes the flag on the mast to wave?\nCourage! What makes the elephant charge his tusk, in the misty mist or the dusky dusk?\nWhat makes the muskrat guard his musk?\nCourage! What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder?\nCourage! What makes the dawn come up like thunder?\nCourage! What makes the Hottentot so hot? What puts the \"ape\" in apricot?\nWhat have they got that I ain't got?\nCourage!\n```\n\nWhat movie did it come from?  That's right, the Wizard of Oz.\n\nI read you that because today's message is a message about courage.\n\nWe live in a trying time.  The world is turning sharply against the message of the gospel.  They never really liked it - they always have held Bible believing Christians in scorn - but they are very, very vocal about it now and growing more so all the time.  They are beginning to, more and more, push anti-biblical and frankly anti-common sense ideas.  This whole transgender bathrooms thing is a good example. There was some news this week about adult strollers.  Yes - you heard that right.  Not for handicapped people.  Just for adults who want to be kids again.  There are people out there who \"self-identify\" as a six year old, even though they are fully grown.  Trans-toddlers I guess you would call them.  It's absurd.\n\nBut it's also accepted and more and more it's going to be mandated.  So what is a Christian to do?\n\nI think we ought to speak out boldly against it.  We ought to be loving.  We ought to remember that these folks that are pushing this stuff are souls for whom Christ died and they are just manifesting different symptoms of the same sin we all struggle with.  But we have to speak out for truth.\n\nBut here is the thing you have to understand: When you speak out for truth when it's not popular - their will be consequences.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  If you take an unpopular stand - it you won't be popular.  If you tell the emperor that his new clothes don't exist, you might end up in prison.  Some people will believe you - some people will despise you.\n\nIf there is one message, one truth, that has always been unpopular, that has always made people angry - it's the gospel of Jesus Christ.  \n\nListen, if you boldly share the gospel of Jesus Christ - there will be consequences. But there will also be miracles.\n\nIf we are going to share the gospel as we ought to, it's going to require courage.  \n\nOur story this morning is a great example of that.\n\n---\n\nTake your Bibles and turn with me to Acts 14. Acts 14.  We are going to look at almost all of the passage today.  This is the last real story in what was Paul's first missionary journey - and it's an interesting one.duc\n\nLet's take a look:\n\nWe are going to read 7 chapter 14 verses 1-20.\n\n> *\"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed. But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren. Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. But the multitude of the city was divided:and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles. And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: And there they preached the gospel\"*\n\n> *\"And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked: The same heard Paul speak:who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein: Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness. And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that they had not done sacrifice unto them\"*\n\n> *\"And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city:and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe\"*\n\nThe title of the message is \"When they throw rocks.\"  \n\nI listen to a political commentator named Ben Shapiro a lot.  I first heard about Ben Shapiro because of some things that kept happening when he visited college campuses.  He'd get invited to speak by some college group and then people would protest.  They would shout at anyone who tried to get in.  They would go into his meeting and yell.  They would pull the fire alarm.  People that actually want to go to the meetings have to find an alternate entrance because, often, protesters will block the door.\n\nNow, this guy is a pretty level headed guy.  He's not a skinhead.  He's not a Nazi.  He's not a racist.  He just says common sense stuff and some of it isn't politically correct and so his detractors will do almost anything to shut him up.\n\nBut they've never thrown rocks.  They've never tried to kill him.\n\nIn the story this morning - Paul deals with all kinds of opposition - culminating in him being stoned.  A mob literally through rocks at him until they thought he was dead.\n\nLet's see why.  I'm breaking down my message this morning into three parts:\n* What the haters do\n* What the courageous do\n* What God does\n\n**Let's pray and then get into this story:**\n\nThis passage takes place in three cities.  First Paul travels to Iconium\n\nHe does in Iconium exactly what he did last week in Antioch of Pisidia.  He goes into the synagogue and he preaches the gospel.  He tells people about Jesus and how Jesus died to save them.\n\nAnd He has the same results.  A great multitude believe.  That's awesome.  Praise the Lord.  That's a great multitude who will be in heaven.  Who will have Christian homes and raise Christian kids.  That's fantastic.\n\nBut not everyone liked it.  In fact, some people hated it.  Look at verse 2:\n\n> *\"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren.\"*\n\nSo, let's look at our first point...\n\n# 1. What the haters do\n\nand the first thing they do is:\n\n## They reject the truth.\n\nNotice this - some people believed - some people resisted.  To some people it was the greatest news they had ever heard but to others it was fighting words.\n\nThere are going to be people who, when they hear the gospel, get angry.  Get mad.  It's the best news in the whole world - but most who have heard it rejected it.\n\nThat's what many of these people in Iconium did, but they went beyond just rejecting the truth, they...\n\n## They slandered the truthful\n\nThey did something about it.  \n\nThey went around spreading lies about Paul and Barnabas.\n\nThis has always been one of the Devil's favorite tactics.  You know, in the early church the Romans believed all kinds of crazy things about the Christians, including that the Lord's supper was a human sacrifice.  THey thought they were political revolutionaries.  Crazy and unbelievable stuff.  But people said it about them and some people believed them.\n\nSlander.\n\nDo you know if you take a bold stand for God - some people won't like it?  Some people might even say some untrue things about you. They might even say you've joined a cult.  They might call you names.  They might even run around with their fingers in their ears and shout nanna-nanna-boo-boo.\n\nSeveral years ago there was a push to kick Chick-fil-a off of the Eastern Illinois campus because, in their words \"it didn't fit their values.\"  I wrote an article in the paper and I said basically - that if you go down this route - where does it stop?  \n\nWould you believe that a few weeks later, there was an article in the paper about me?  Someone who I've never met called me all kinds of nice names like false prophet and bigot.\n\nLook - if you are going to preach the gospel and take a stand for the truth not everyone is going to like it.  Some people will hate it.\n\nThat's part of it.\n\nBut in Paul's case, it went beyond slander.  They moved from slander to:\n\n## Threats\n\nLook at verse:\n\n> *\" And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe\"*\n\nThe slander didn't work well enough.  People were still believing the gospel and getting saved.  So the enemies of the gospel ratcheted it up a notch and started planning to stone Paul.\n\nNow notice - it mentions the rulers here.  There were some powerful people in on this.  And they are making plans.  They are conspiring.\n\nChurch - let me tell you that if you stand for the truth - no matter how lovingly - there may be people who conspire against you.  You may be passed up for a job promotion.  You may be ruled out in public service.  It may be worse.\n\nSo Paul so how serious this was and he decided it was better for him and Barnabas to leave.  No shame in that.  So they went on to Derbe and Lystra.  These were nearby cities, but outside of the governmental reach of Iconium.  It would be like going from Mattoon to Terre Haute.  \n\nAnd what did they do in Derbe in Lystra - the same thing they did in Iconium, the same thing they did in Antioch of Pisidia - they preached Jesus.\n\n---\n\nNow, there is an interesting story here.  I'm not going to get into it very much. But when Barnabas and Paul were preaching in Lystra, they healed someone and due to some local tradition, they were mistaken as gods.  They even had the local priest come out and try to offer bulls to them.\n\nSo immediately their message changed to \"we aren't God's but let me tell you about God and His son Jesus\"  \n\n---\n\nThis brings me to the fourth thing that the haters sometimes do.  Sometimes...\n\n##### They hurt\n\nIn Lystra, some of the people from Iconium caught up with them and started making trouble and telling lies there and this time - they did stone Paul.  They literally got a mob to pick up rocks and throw them at Paul until he was dead (or at least they thought.)  Then, because they didn't want to get in trouble, they dragged his dead body outside of town.\n\nNow, Paul wasn't dead. We'll get to that in a second.\n\nBut here is the point - sometimes the haters do hurt you.  Sometimes it goes beyond threats. \n\nWe support a missionary named John Leonard.  Brother Leonard was starting a church in one of the worst slums in Brazil.  God was blessing. People were getting saved.  Lots of people.\n\nWhen those people got saved, they stopped buying drugs from the local cartel.  They stopped putting money in their pockets.  So after enough of this went on the cartel put a hit on John Leonard's life and one day, outside of their church, a hit man walked up to John Leonard and shot him multiple times and left him for dead.\n\nSometimes, if you serve Christ, people will hurt you.  Real violence can happen.  We are fortunate that it doesn't happen here in AMerica very often but it could.  \n\nSo what do the haters do?  Everything they can to hurt the message of Jesus Christ.\n\nBut let's move on and look at...\n\n# 2. What the courageous do\n\nWhat did Paul and Barnabas do in this harsh opposition? I want you to see three things:\n\nFirst,\n\n## They keep speaking the truth in the face of lies.\n\nI love verse 3, Paul and Barnabas are getting lied about.  They are getting slandered.  Threats are starting to come in. And what is their response?  Look at verse 3:\n\n> *\"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands\"**\n\nThey didn't run from trouble - they tried to teach their way out of trouble.  They knew they had the truth so they just kept preaching the truth and telling people what God had said.\n\nThe old preacher John Wesley used to say \n\n> \"Always look a crowd in the face\"\n\nYou can do that when you have the truth.  You aren't afraid of scrutiny - you invite it.  You aren't afraid of questions - let them come - you'll answer them.\n\nDo you know what I want to do when people are saying nasty things about me?  I want to get out of there.  I want to run.  But that's not what Paul did.  He kept on preaching.\n\nI think a second thing we see that he did and that courageous people do is....\n\n## They keep trusting the God they can't see in the face of the enemy they can see.\n\nThis is amazing faith.  You have an angry crowd of people around you and they are threatening you and they are lying about you and they are trying to shut you up.  That's scary.\n\nBut Paul and Barnabas just trusted God.  They trusted God's truth to do it's work.  They trusted God's power to back them up.  They trusted God's calling on their life.  They trusted God.\n\nI was listening to a lecture this week about Martin Luther.  We don't agree with everything Luther did or said, but their is no doubt he loved God and was used to open the doors of true salvation for many, many people.\n\nWhen Luther was on trial before the Pope's court - he could have lost his life.  He could have been mercilessly tortured.  Many people before him had.  He was before the most powerful forces on this earth.  But do you know what he said, he said\n\n> Here I stand, I can do no other. So help me God.\n\nIt takes faith to trust God when you are going through the valley of the shadow of death.  It takes faith to trust God when the enemies are hurling their darts and sharpening their teeth.\n\nBut it's not a foolish faith - because no matter how powerful the enemies may seem they aren't more powerful than God.\n\nLet me show you one more thing that the courageous do:\n\n# They keep going in the face of more.\n\nWhen Paul and Barnabas hit the wall in Iconium, they went to Lystra for more of the same.  What's amazing is what we see at the end of the chapter.  Paul got stoned.  Not Bob Marley stoned.  Literally bludgeoned to the point where everyone thought he was dead.\n\nAnd what does he do?  Look at verses 19-21.  These are some of the most amazing verses in the Bible:\n\n> *\"And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead. Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city:and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch\"*\n\nPaul gets up when everyone else thinks he's dead and he go's right back into the city where he was stoned.  Then he goes right back to preaching the gospel.  Eventually, he even visits these cities again where so many people hated him.\n\nHe kept going.\n\nHold your finger here and turn with me to Acts 20 for a second.  Acts 20.  Look at verse 24.  This is Paul talking about all that he's gone through for the gospel and look what he says in verse 24:\n\n> *\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God\"*\n\nThat's courage.\n\nI told you about John Leonard getting shot.  He's paralyzed from the waste down.  Do you know where he is today?  He's in a slum in Brazil preaching to people from a wheelchair.\n\nListen folks, keep serving God.  Keep standing for the truth.  If it's hard keep going.  If they throw rocks keep going.  Don't let the darkness put the light out.  Keep it shining bright for Jesus.\n\nThere is one more thing I want to show you before we close and that is:\n\n# 3. What God does\n\nWe've seen what the haters did and what the courageous did.  Let's see what God did here.  Let me quickly go through this:\n\nFirst,\n\n## God empowers\n\nGod empowered Paul and Barnabas to preach in the middle of opposition. He empowered them to even do miracles to back up his word.\n\nYou know there is this old saying \"God will never give you more than you can handle.\"  It's poppycock.  It's ridiculous.  God gives us more than we can handle all the time.  But do you know what - he's there to handle it with us and there is nothing He can't handle.\n\nSo God empowers.  God empowers you to speak in the first place.  He empowers you to keep going when it get's tough.  He empowers you to be bold in the face of enemies.  He empowers you to get up when they knock you down.\n\nBut that's not the greatest thing that happens in this passage.  The greatest thing is...\n\n## God saves\n\nHere is the greatest thing about this story - everywhere Paul went and the gospel was preached - people got saved.  Even when the enemies were hurling rocks and throwing lies - people were believing the gospel and having their lives changed.\n\nSo I ask you - was it worth it?  Was it worth the lies and the danger and the violence?  \n\nSouls are in heaven today that would be in Hell.  I'd say it's worth it.\n\nLet me read Paul's statement in Acts 20 again:\n\n> *\"But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God\"*\n\nPaul looked back at all this and said - I finish my course with joy.  I get to tell people about Jesus and see Jesus change their lives.  Yes.  It's worth it.\n\nChurch - in open Antioch - the gospel works.  In pagan Lystra - the gospel works.  in violent Brazil - the gospel works.  In communist China, the gospel works.  In Godless china - the gospel works. In Mattoon, Illinois - the gospel works.\n\nWill it take courage - yep.  Will their be consquences - you betcha - but one of those consequences will be people getting saved.  That's worth it.\n\nLet's stand and pray.",

    "body": "I want you to take your Bibles with me again and turn to Genesis. Tonight we are going to look at one of the most famous - to some infamous - passages in the Bible - the story of God's judgement on Sodom.\n\nEvery sermon I've ever heard or read on this chapter follows one of two courses: * The first is a condemnation of the sin of sodomy. What our world today calls homosexuality.\n\nI want to say clearly that God's word condemns homosexuality from start to finish. Specifically, it teaches us that it is an affront against nature and that it is the ultimate result of a society that doesn't want to honor God. God made men and women to be compatible. It's the only combination that can produce children. It's clear from the beginning that it is Adam and Eve. That's God's intention. And God has promised many times in both the Old and New Testaments to punish sodemy.\n\nNow, listen, that's not an easy thing to say anymore. Not in our culture. But we don't get to change the truth just because it's no longer popular.\n\nSo that's one way people preach this - focusing on the sin of homosexuality.\n\nThe second way people preach this passage is to focus on Lot. Lot is an example of what it looks like to be a totally backslidden worldly Christian. (That's actually what I'm going to be doing, and I'm borrowing the main points of my outline from another preacher.)\nYou see, 2 Peter 2:8 says this about Lot:\n\n\"(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds;)\"\n\nIt calls Lot a righteous man. I think that means he was a saved man. But he didn't live like it.\n\nHe lived a very worldly life.\n\nNow, I want to talk about wordliness for a little bit.\n\nJames 4:4 says:\n\n\"Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God\"\n\nObviously, we aren't supposed to be worldly. 1 John 2:15 says:\n\n\"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\"\n\nSo, there is something called \"the world\" and we are supposed to not love it. We are supposed to stay away from it. I want to address one wrong thought that some people have about the world and worldliness and it's this. Some people take these verses and they think just about everything is worldly. I mean, basically, if anyone in the world does something they say it's worldly. What happens with those people is they become sort of dualistic. They start to think that the body and human life is intrinsically evil and the spirit is intrinsically good.\n\nThat's the mentality that led to monasteries and monks. That's the mentality that leads to priests not marrying. It's a heresy.\n\nPaul said in 1 Timothy 4:4-5:\n\n\"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.\"\n\nThere is this subtle idea that if something appeals to your flesh in any way it's bad and that's just not biblical.\n\nSo that gets thrown into the mix.\n\nSo worldliness isn't talking about this physical world and it can't be applied to all of human life. God created human life and called it good. He wants us to enjoy it and thank Him for it.\n\nSo what is worldliness then? Look back at 1 John 2:16:\n\n\"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.\"\n\nSo here is what worldliness is: It is wanting to do what God doesn't want you to do (the lust of the flesh), wanting to have what God doesn't want you to have (the lust of the eyes) and wanting to be what God doesn't want you to be (the pride of life.) Basically, worldliness is trying to live in this world like God doesn't exist. Doing your own thing to make you happy rather than trusting God for that. Making your own rules. Setting your own path.\n\nAnd there is a whole system - and that's what it is referring to when it says \"love not the world\" the world system. There is this whole world system of things that are trying to get by without God.\n\nWe have to live in the world but not be of the world. An old preacher named Griffeth Thomas said this:\n\nA ship in the water is perfectly right, but the water in the ship is perfectly wrong. The Christian in the world is right and necessary, the world in the Christian is wrong and disastrous.\n\nWhat happens when the water gets in the boat? What happens when the world get's in the Christian? There probably isn't a better example of that in the Bible than this story of Lot.\n\nRemember - Lot is righteous. He is saved. He was raised by Abraham. He knows God. He knows the laws of God. But lot has decided he would rather have the city life of the wicked people in Sodom than the influence of his godly uncle Abraham.\n\nSo what happens when a Christian lives too close to the world? Let's look at this text and see:\n\n1. You cannot evade the corruption\nIN other words, if you get too comfy with the world, you'll have to deal with the world's corruption. As you look at this story - You see Lot now living inside of the city of Sodom. This wicked, wicked city is now home to him. More than that - He's a leader of this city. He was something like a congressman from the city - an important person there.\n\nMaybe Lot thought \"I can just live here and work here and be around it, but it won't really affect me.\" But it did church, it did.\n\nNotice...\n\nA. It will attack you (3-9)\nSo these Angels visit Lot and Lot says to the angels \"Please, come in and stay for awhile.\" To which the angels say \"no.\"\n\nBy the way, the same angels acted totally different to Abraham. They accepted Abraham's hospitality and ate Abraham's food. They fellowshipped with Abraham. They keep their distance with Lot.\n\nSo Lot starts begging the angels to come in. Why? We find out that all of the men of Sodom start pounding on Lot's door saying \"Where are the men? Bring them out to us that we may know them.\" I love that the Bible is so delicate here. But what these men were doing was disgusting. They wanted to gang rape these angels.\n\nThis is a sick, sick wicked place. A place where the majority of it's men were so burnt up with lusts that they would demand to rape angels. It's sickening.\n\nAnd they are persistent. They keep pounding on the door. Yelling at Lot. Threatening him.\n\nNotice the next point:\n\nB. It will affect you (7-8)\nNotice what Lot does. At first he seems brave. He tells the men \"do not so wickedly.\" He stands up to them.\n\nBut then, when the men are persistent - he does something unspeakable. He offers his own daughters to the men.\n\nDo you know what I think when I read that? I think \"This man is a waste of life.\" Who in the world would do such a thing?\n\nThe water got in the boat. The world rubbed off on Lot. It affected him.\n\nListen church - don't think you can get too close to the world and worldliness and it not affect you. It's going to affect you. Evil communications corrupt good manners. You can't play with fire and not get burned. When you play around with worldliness, it takes you farther than you intended. Every. Single. Time.\n\nSo, 1. You cannot evade the culture. Number 2 is:\n\n2. You cannot engage the culture\nNot only was backslidden lot not able to keep the culture off of him, he wasn't able to do any good in the culture because of his lack of testimony.\n\nWe are supposed to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world. But notice Lot couldn't do anything about the culture he was in.\n\nNotice in this story that when you get too close to the world...\n\nA. You won't be able to confront it. (9)\nIn verses 8 and 9 Lot offers his daughters to the crowd, then he says 'They came under the shadow of my roof.' He's saying to these people \"be decent, show hospitality. Don't do this wicked thing.\"\n\nNotice what the men say in verse 9:\n\n\"This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them\"\n\nLet me translate that for you. What they were saying was \"This guy Lot comes here and joins us and our culture - then tries to judge us? Who are you to judge? We are going to be worse to you than to them.\"\n\nLook, Lot came into Sodom and never said anything about the wickedness. He accepted it. He might not of partook in it, but he gave it a nod. Now, when it matters to him, he has no ground to stand on.\n\nWhen you get too close to the world, you aren't going to be able to confront it. Listen, if you listen to all the filthy jokes at work - dont' kid yourself into thinking you have any moral ground with those people.\n\nYou won't be able to confront it. Secondly we see:\n\nB. You won't be able to convince it.\n(12-14)\n\nIn verses 12-14 the angels blind the men, then send Lot out to get his sons in law and married daughters. So Lot goes out and tells his sons and daughters that God is going to judge the city and that they need to get out.\n\nNotice what verse 14 says:\n\n\"And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the Lord will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.\"\n\nLook, Lot had no ground to stand on with his own kids.\n\nTerry Trivette said this about Lot:\n\nIt does no good to cry like Chicken Little \"They sky is falling\" when you have sunbathing under it all day.\n\nWhen we as Christians speak to the world about Hell and judgment, we had better live like we believe those exist if we expect them to believe us. If we expect our kids to believe us when we talk about God - we had better live like God is real.\n\nWe remove all of our moral authority when we refuse to take a stand on anything or live like any of it is real.\n\nSo if you get too close to the world, you cannot evade the corruption, you cannot engage the culture, you\n\n3. You cannot escape the consequences.\nThe saddest part of this story is the destruction that happens, not just to Sodom but to Lot. We see what the long term effects of Lot's living in Sodom has done in his life and in his families life.\n\nFirst, look at...\n\nA. The effects on his faith.\n(16-17) he has to be dragged out. (18-20) he asks to go to another city\n\nB. The effects on his family.\nLot's wife (26) Lot's daughters (31-36)",

    "body": "# Crazy Jesus, Satanic Jesus, Stealing Jesus (Mark 3:20-30)\nMy message this morning is about the most important question that you can ask: **Who was Jesus really?**\n\nThe Christian answer to that question is that Jesus is the Son of God; that Jesus is the perfect Savior of mankind; that Jesus is the promised Messiah.  Jesus is the God-man—perfectly man and perfectly God—who was sent to do what we cannot do: Live a perfect life and die in our place to pay for our sins.  The Bible teaches that Jesus showed power over demons, power over sickness, and finally, power over death.  That’s the biblical Jesus.\n\nBut if you were to do one of those “man on the street” interviews so popular today and just asked random people who Jesus was, what answer would you get?  Put another way: If you were to ask people to answer the question honestly with no pretense, what would they say?\n\nThe stock answer in the world is that Jesus was a good man.  He was a great human teacher.  Some would say He was a political revolutionary that went too far but had a lot of good ideas.  The world puts Jesus on the same footing as people like Marcus Aurelius, the great stoic philosopher and Roman Emperor, or they put him in the same category of a Buddha, a Gandhi, or a Confucius.  In other words, He was a great teacher and a wise man.\n\nI want to tell you that is an absolutely absurd position.  C.S. Lewis said it this way:\n\n>   A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said wouldn’t be a great moral teacher.  He’d either be a lunatic - on a level with a man who believes he is a poached egg - or else he’d be the Devil of Hell.  You must make your choice.  Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse.  You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God.  But don’t let us come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher.  He hasn’t left that open to us.  He didn’t intend to.\n\nJesus has to be either God, a crazy man, or the devil.  He didn’t give us much of a fourth option.  \n\nIn our text this morning, we are going to look at two very different groups of people that both rejected Jesus as Messiah, and we are also going to talk about one of the most troubling and misunderstood ideas in the Christian faith—the unpardonable sin.  The main thing I want you to settle this morning—if you haven’t already—is the question I started with: “Who is Jesus, really?”  Was He a madman?  Was He Satan?  Was He some good human teacher?  Or was He and is He whom He claims to be?\n\nLet’s read Mark 3:20-30 this morning:\n\n> *”20 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. 21 And when his friends heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself. 22 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils. 23 And he called them [unto him], and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? 24 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 25 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 26 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end. 27 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house. 28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.”*\n\nI’m going to give you four points this morning as we walk through this text:\n* The intervention\n* The accusation\n* The explanation \n* The admonition\n\n**Let’s pray and we’ll look at those.**\n\nThe first point thing we see in this passage is...\n\n## 1. The Intervention (20-21)\n\nIn verse 20, it tells us that Jesus was so busy healing people that he couldn’t even eat bread.  In other words, He was too busy to eat.\n\nHave you been there?  Have you ever been so consumed with what you are doing that you skip meals?  I know what this is like.\n\nAnyway, in the middle of this verse 21, it says:\n\n> *”And when his friends heard [of it], they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.”*\n\nThere is actually a lot going on in this verse.  The word “friends” here actually refers to Jesus’ people.  He’s back near his hometown here, and it was probably His family and the people Jesus grew up around.  Remember that they aren’t believers yet.  They see the way that Jesus is living, and they think, “We have to do something. We have to stage an intervention.  He’s beside Himself.  He’s lost His mind.”\n\nSo they are coming into this story to try to take Jesus by force, bring Him home, and straighten Him out somehow.\n\nWhy would they do this?  They did it because they loved Jesus.  They did it because, in their mind, Jesus was acting like a crazy man.  He gave up His business to be homeless.  He surrounded Himself with this ragtag group of nobodies.  He spent all night out in prayer under the skies.  He’s too busy to even eat.  It’s time for an intervention.\n\nSeveral times I’ve had people who love me come and try to stage an intervention.  When I announced to my family I was going to be a preacher, there were interventions galore.  Suddenly, more family members wanted to take me out to breakfast than I could handle.  They all said the same thing: “It’s crazy for you to throw your life away and be a preacher.”  \n\nEven today, I get occasional interventions from family who say, “Come home, and get a job as a web developer here.  Make good money.  Be near your family.”  \n\nSo I know what this is like.  Maybe you’ve had some of these well-meaning interventions in your life.  Maybe you’ve had your parents or your siblings say, “It’s crazy to be so into church,” or, “It’s crazy for you to put your kids in a Christian school.”  Maybe coworkers think it’s crazy that you don’t party, that you don’t drink or that you don’t cuss and tell dirty jokes, and they genuinely want to “help” you by pulling you aside and telling you to lighten up. \n\nSo Jesus had His family and friends come to Him to try to stage an intervention because they thought He was losing it.  They thought He was crazy.\n\nThat’s the first thing that we see here: The intervention.   The second thing is...\n\n## 2. The Accusation (22)\nIn verse 22, it tells us...\n\n> *”And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils.”*\n\nSo these scribes and Pharisees (Matthew tells us it was Pharisees, too) make the journey north from Jerusalem to see Jesus, and they make a public accusation.  Their public accusation was this: Jesus is possessed by the devil, and the only way Jesus has the power He has is because He Himself is demon-possessed.\n\nSo Jesus’ people think He’s crazy, and the powers that be think He’s Satan.  Notice that they aren’t denying that Jesus had power. They couldn’t.  It was on public display, but they are saying that Jesus’ power comes from Satan and that Jesus is Satanic.\n\nNow that is ridiculous.  It’s ridiculous because Jesus’ entire character is pure.  It’s ridiculous because Jesus is going around living in the exact opposite way that Satan would live and doing the exact opposite things Satan would do.  \n\nBut that’s not Jesus’ answer.  Look at the next point...\n\n## 3. The Explanation (23-27)\n\nTo answer these scribes and Pharisees Jesus makes two points:\n\n### First, no group can undermine itself and survive.\n\nThat’s what Jesus meant when He said, *“A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.”* If a nation descends into a civil war, the end is near.  If a church starts infighting, it’s probably going to be closing soon.  If a family is bickering and arguing all the time, divorce is probably on the way.\n\nWhat Jesus was saying was that this is ridiculous.  Why would Satan undermine himself?  Why would Satan fight against Satan?  \n\nThe second point Jesus made is actually awesome, He said:\n\n### I came to spoil Satan, and in order to do that I have to bind the strong man first.\n\nLook at verse 27:\n\n> *”No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.”*\n\nLet me explain this verse a little because it teaches an awesome truth.  Jesus is comparing himself to a robber here—a robber that wants to enter into someone else’s castle or someone else’s mansion and take their valuables.  Jesus says that the first step is beating the security and tying them up.\n\nNow get this.  Here is what this means.  \n\nThis world is the devil’s house.  He is the “prince of the power of the air” and the “ruler of the darkness of this world.”  People who aren’t saved people are under the power of Satan.  This is his house.\n\nJesus came to spoil Satan.  Jesus came to take what belongs to Satan.  Do you know what that is?  It’s you!  If you are a saved person today, then you are living spoils.  You belonged to Satan, but Jesus came in and took you back by force.\n\nNow in order for Jesus to steal from Satan, Jesus has to bind up the security.  He has to tie up the strong man.  In other words, Jesus has to show His power over the forces of the devil.\n\nNow here is why I love this verse so much.  This verse teaches us that if you are a saved person, Jesus has already tied up the devil’s demons.  He’s already bound the strongman, and you are living spoil.  \n\nAnother way to look at it—maybe a more flattering way—is to say that Jesus mounted an awesome ninja rescue mission and took you back from the kidnapper.  He had to go in there and beat up the bad guys and tie them up so He could walk out with the spoil, which is you.\n\nSo remember this next time you are feeling like you are under the forces of the devil and evil: You are Jesus’ spoil! Jesus has already tied up the bad guys for you.  You don’t have to do it because Jesus already did.  Isn’t that awesome?\n\nSo we’ve seen the intervention, the accusation, and the explanation.  The last thing I want you to see here is...\n\n## 4. The Admonition (28-30)\nJesus doesn’t just give these guys an explanation of how He isn’t working for Satan. Jesus gives them a warning.  \n\nLook at verses 28-30 again:\n\n> *”28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation: 30 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.”*\n\nJesus warns these scribes and Pharisees that they are in the danger zone of committing the one sin that God won’t forgive: *”Blaspheming against the Holy Ghost.”*\n\nThere is probably more confusion about this sin than anything.  Sometimes good Christian people get all bent out of shape worrying that they have committed this unpardonable sin and that they have blasphemed the Holy Ghost.\n\nSo what is this sin?  It super important for us to understand this.\n\nLet me tell you what it is up front, and then I’ll explain it from the text.  The one sin that will not be forgiven is rejecting Jesus.\n\nThat’s it.  It is looking at Jesus and what Jesus is doing, and saying finally and forcefully, “He’s wicked. He’s crazy. I want nothing to do with that Jesus.”\n\nYou see, Jesus was talking to Jews here.  They didn’t have the New Testament teaching about the Holy Ghost.  They had a very limited understanding of what the Holy Ghost does, so we have to bear that in mind.  Jewish people saw two jobs of the Holy Ghost:\n\n* The Holy Ghost reveals God’s truth.\n* The Holy Ghost enables men to recognize God’s truth when they see it.\n\nSo for these people to blaspheme the Holy Ghost, what they were doing is rejecting the truth that the Holy Ghost was revealing to them about Jesus.  They were rejecting Jesus.\n\nKent Hughes explains it this way:\n\n> The unforgivable sin is very simply the ongoing continual rejection of the witness of the Holy Spirit to the divinity and saviorhood of Christ.  It is continuing rejection of the witness of the Holy Spirit, whether that witness be a quiet witness in the conscience, the rational witness of the Word, or even miracles and wonders.\n\nLet me read you what another preacher said:\n\n> It isn’t that God gets especially angry with one sin in particular.  It’s rather that if you decide firmly that the doctor who is offering to perform a life-saving operation on you is in fact a sadistic murderer, you will never give consent to the operation.\n\nSo put simply: The unforgivable sin is the ongoing rejection of Jesus.  That’s it.\n\nNow here is what that means.  That means if you are a Christian—if you’ve trusted Jesus—you absolutely cannot commit this unforgivable sin.  It’s impossible, so you need to push this worry from your mind.  You are saved and safe in Jesus.\n\nBut if you aren’t a Christian—if you haven’t trusted Jesus—it means you are in the danger zone.  If you are hearing the gospel over and over and saying to yourself, “That’s crazy,” and, “I want no part in that,” and you don’t change your mind, you will commit the one sin that Jesus won’t forgive. That sin is ultimately and finally rejecting His offer of salvation. As a result, you will face your Maker outside of Jesus and be judged for your sins.\n\nNow let me be clear.  This doesn’t mean that if you reject the gospel once, twice, twenty, or a thousand times, you’ve committed the unforgivable sin.  The apostle Paul no doubt heard the gospel many times as he was persecuting Christians, and yet God still saved Him.  I don’t even think these scribes and Pharisees had committed this sin yet, or else Jesus wouldn’t be warning them.\n\nBut they were in the danger zone.  And folks, if you’ve never trusted Christ, you are in the danger zone.  You are on thin ice.  You aren’t promised a tomorrow.  People die suddenly and tragically every day.  No man knows the day or the hour.  If you don’t accept Christ—if you continue to reject Him—our text says you are:\n\n> *”in danger of eternal damnation”*\n\n\n# Conclusion\nSo who is Jesus?  He couldn’t have been just a moral teacher.  His own family and his contemporaries got it right. He was either mad, Satanic, or He is who He says He is.  He is the Son of God and the Savior of the world.\n\nWho do you say that He is?  If He isn’t your Savior—if you are still rejecting Him—you are in danger of committing the one sin God won’t forgive, which is saying no to the offer of salvation one last and final time.\n\nWhy not trust Jesus as your Savior today?  Why not recognize Him for who He really is?",

    "body": "Throughout history, there have been many conquerors and empires that have sought to rule the world. We can think of Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon, Alexander the Great and Greece, the Roman Empire, and Genghis Khan. In more recent history, we’ve seen men like Napoleon, Lenin, and Hitler. In the future, the Antichrist will take the stage as a powerful conqueror seeing to create a one world government. All of these people (and many others) have one thing in common: They failed. So who is worthy to have the right to rule over all the earth? That’s what this chapter reveals to us. \n\n[Read Revelation 5]\n\nOne day, Jesus Christ will take what is rightfully His, and that is the central theme of John’s vision in this chapter. \n\nI. The Sealed Scroll (5:1-4)\n\n--The right hand is the place of power and authority. The fact that there was writing on both sides of the scroll is a callback to Ezekiel 2, where the scroll the prophet received also had writing on both sides. It wasn’t common practice to write on both sides of a scroll. The reason there is writing on both sides of the scroll is because God had much to say, and because He has said all there is to say. No one needs to add to God’s Word. It is sufficient as it is. \n\n--These were not seven writings each separated by a seal, but these seven seals were on one scroll. All seven seals had to be opened before the scroll could be read, which is what chapter 6 primarily deals with. \n\n--What is written on this scroll? There has been a lot of speculation by scholars and commentators, but we have to be careful about trying to speak definitively in areas where the Bible doesn’t speak definitively. There are some who have tried to argue that this is the title deed to the earth, which sounds like it fits thematically because the coming tribulation ends with Christ ruling on the earth. They say that God gave the “deed” to mankind back in Genesis 1, when He gave man dominion over the earth, but then man lost it to Satan in the Garden of Eden. Their basis for this claim is that the devil is called the prince of this world or the god of this world on a few occasions in the New Testament. \n\n--Those who ascribe to this theory reference an event in Jeremiah 32:6-15 [Read verses]. In this passage, Jeremiah’s cousin Hanameel is desperate to sell a field he owned in Jeremiah’s hometown of Anathoth, a small town only a few miles outside of Jerusalem. Hanameel knew that once the Babylonians conquered Judah, he would lose this plot of ground, so he’s aiming to make a last-minute profit off of its sale. God told Jeremiah to go ahead and buy the field as a sign that the Babylonian captivity would not be permanent, but it would once again be owned and inhabited by the Jews. After signing the deed, there was a copy made that was sealed as evidence that the field now belonged to Jeremiah.\n\n--Those who don’t hold to the idea that this scroll is a title deed of the earth say that the Bible still declares multiple times that the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof. Plus, the Father holds the title deed in His hand. It hasn’t been lost to anyone. \n\n--There are some who claim that this scroll is God’s final will and testament for the present universe since the book of Revelation ends with the new heavens and the new earth. This is based on a Roman custom that wills were sealed seven times, each from a witness to the validity of the will. The basic idea is that God has a scroll in which the history of the universe has already been written in advance, and He holds it in His hand until history’s climax. \n\n--Regardless of what is written on this scroll, it is important to remember that the emphasis here is not on the content of the scroll, but on the seven seals and the One who is worthy to open them. John makes it clear that literally no one in worthy other than Jesus Christ. It says that they searched everywhere to find someone worthy but came up empty until Jesus showed up. \n\n--When they can’t find anyone worthy to open the scroll, John begins to weep. This is the only time we see tears in the book of Revelation except when it says that God will wipe away all tears from our eyes. This was something worth weeping over because without Christ, all hope is lost. Without Christ, sin’s curse will destroy us. Without Christ, only an eternity in hell awaits us. Thankfully, this isn’t the end of the story. \n\nII. The Sufficient Savior (5:5-7)\n\n--The basis for Jesus Christ being considered worthy to open the seven seals is His death on the cross followed by His resurrection, as well as the salvation it purchased for us. One of the elders calls Him the Lion of the tribe of Judah, which echoes back to the Messianic prophecy that Jacob gave to his son back in Genesis 49:8-10, which says, “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow down before thee. Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up? The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” He also calls Him the Root of David, which references Isaiah 11:10, another Messianic prophecy. “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious.”\n\n--The elder calls Jesus a Lion, but John sees a Lamb. Even in the midst of all the splendor and wonder described in chapters 4 and 5, John’s eyes can’t help but be drawn to Christ. He is the centerpiece of heaven. Jesus is only referred to as a Lamb once in the Old Testament (in Isaiah 53:7) and four times elsewhere in the New Testament, but He is called the Lamb 31 times in Revelation. The lion is a symbol of strength and majesty as the king of beasts. The lamb is gentle and a symbol of sacrifice, especially since Christ still bears the marks of His sacrifice. The Greek word John uses here even specifies this is a little lamb. Few things are more fearsome than a lion, while few things could be less intimidating than a little lamb. It is fitting that Jesus is simultaneously a symbol of both power and gentleness, both majesty and sacrificial love. \n\n-- John describes Him as a Lamb as it had been slain, meaning that Jesus still bears the wounds from the cross in His body, although they no longer harm Him. The idea is that the sacrifice of Christ is still fresh and viable in the eyes of the Father. There is nothing stagnant or outdated about His work on the cross. As the song says, His blood will never lose its power. \n\n--Even though Jesus is seen as a Lamb, He is not meant to be viewed as an object of pity. He is alive even after His sacrifice. He has seven horns, representing His omnipotence (seven being the number of completion and horns being a symbol of strength in the Bible) and seven eyes, representing His omniscience. The seven Spirits going throughout the whole earth represent His omnipresence. \n\n--Jesus being able to take the scroll from the Father’s hand indicates a transfer of authority and an acknowledgement that He is indeed worthy to open the scroll and release the contents within. The vision that began in chapter 4 has been building up to this moment. This is what all of history has been building up to: The moment when Jesus Christ comes forward to claim what is rightfully His. The final step in God’s unfolding plan of redemption is about to be put into action as He judges the world in righteousness and then restores the paradise that Adam and Eve lost. \n\nIII. The Singing Saints (5:8-14)\n\n--At the end of Revelation 4, God is praised as Creator. Here at the end of Revelation 5, Christ is praised as Redeemer. All the groups in heaven—the beasts, the elders, the angels, and all of creation itself—can’t help but break out in song in anticipation at the prospect of what Jesus is about to do. He is about to accomplish the long-awaited defeat of sin, death, and the devil. \n\n--The fact that the elders and beasts offer the same worship to Christ that they did to the Father in the previous chapter is strong proof of Christ’s deity because only God is to be worshipped. Charles Spurgeon said, “Depend upon it, my hearer, you never will go to heaven unless you are prepared to worship Jesus Christ as God. They are all doing it there: you will have to come to it, and if you entertain the notion that he is a mere man, or that he is anything less than God, I am afraid you will have to begin at the beginning and learn what true religion means. You have a poor foundation to rest upon. I could not trust my soul with a mere man, or believe in an atonement made by a mere man: I must see God himself putting his hand to so gigantic a work.”\n\n--The prayers of the saints are explicitly symbolized here as being golden vials that are full of fragrance. This speaks of the exceptional value of our prayers in the eyes of God and how pleasing it is to Him when we pray. This verse makes it clear that the Lord loves to hear His people pray. It is also worth noting that the elders present the prayers of the saints. They do not function as mediators or intercessors like the Roman Catholic church teaches. As we know from I Timothy 2:5, there is only one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus. \n\n--Worship in heaven is accompanied by music here. This verse is what started that stereotype that everyone in heaven plays harps. \n\n--The song says that God has redeemed people from every kindred, tongue, people, and nation. God wants all people everywhere to be saved. It doesn’t matter who they are, where they’re from, or what they’re background is. The song is enhanced by the diversity of those gathered in heaven singing, much like an orchestra is enhanced by the variety of instruments in it. Imagine the great encouragement this must have been for the apostle John to see during a time when the church was going through a period of intense persecution and threatening to be stamped out by the Emperor Domitian. \n\n--We are kings because we have been born again into the royal family of God, and this is why we will reign with Christ. We are priests because we need no other intercessor or mediator but Christ. \n\n--The elders sing a song of redemption, but the angels do not. They are not the subjects of redemption. They are merely careful observers of God’s work of saving mankind. The angels praise Him for all the things Christ received in return for His death on the cross, not the things they received. \n\n--This scene looks ahead to the fulfillment of Philippians 2:9-11, “Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”\n\n--After all of this, the lingering question hanging in the air is: Do you know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior? Will you one day be a part of this wonderful scene in heaven? If you’re not, God wants you to be there, and He has made a way for you to be there through the blood of His Son. ",

    "body": "Galatians 6: Whose Achievement?\n\nThis morning is kind of a sad day for me, because we are getting close to the end of our series in the book of Galatians.  I’ve been preaching here for six and a half years, and we’ve gone through a lot of scripture together, and every time we do, every single book that we look at changes my outlook a little bit in a way I didn’t anticipate.\n\nNo book of the Bible that I’ve ever looked at has done more to solidify my belief that salvation isn’t because of anything I’ve done, but because of what Jesus has done, than the book of Galatians.  \n\nRemember, this book was written by the Apostle Paul to confront a specific problem.  There were jewish Christians who were trying to make gentile Christians follow the jewish law and the big point that Paul (and the Holy Spirit through Paul) makes in this whole book is that Salvation is by grace, it’s not our works, and the moment you add our works to the mix you mess up the whole thing.\n\nIt’s either grace or works.  You are either saved by grace - by what Jesus has done, or you are saved by works, by what you have done.  ::It’s one or the other.  It’s “do” or it’s “done.”  “Do” stuff to make your way to God or accept what God has already “done.”::  \n\nAnd the message of this book - I believer, is that Christianity is about what Christ has done, not about what we are expected to do.  It’s about Christ’s achievement, not our works.\n\nThat’s how this book starts and that’s how this book ends.  So let’s look at Galatians 6:11-18\n\n> *”[Gal 6:11-18 KJV] 11 Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. 14 But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 16 And as many as walk according to this rule, peace [be] on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 17 From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 18 Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.”*\n\n\nIn Bible times, they had no copy machines.  They had no printers.  They had no screens.  They didn’t even have printing presses.  The only way to record something was to write it out by hand.  Pen to paper.\n\nHow many of you are proud of your penmanship?  I’m certainly not.  I have terrible, terrible penmanship.  I remember in elementary school, when penmanship was a subject, my report card was like A, A, A A A D.  And the D was always in penmanship.   I write thousands of words every week.  I’d be lucky if I write 1000 words a year using a pen and paper.\n\nSo in Bible times, everything was handwritten, and if you had something important to write - something you actually wanted people to read - you would hire a scribe to write it for you.  You would dictate to this scribe who was kind of like a human printer.  He had immaculate, extremely neat handwriting.\n\nProbably all of Paul’s letters were written by dictating to a scribe or a secretary and then, at the end of the book, Paul would write the last paragraph or so in his own handwriting.  So people would know it was actually from him and not a forgery.\n\nThat’s what we have here in verses 11-18.  This is probably the part of the letter Paul wrote in his own handwriting.  Look at verse 11:\n\n> *”Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.”*\n\nI always thought this meant that this was a long letter and Paul wrote it all.  But I actually don’t think that is what it means.  “How large a letter” could also mean “How big handwriting” and I think that is what he is saying here.  I think whether Paul took up the pen to write the last paragraph or wrote the whole thing himself at this point Paul purposely wrote in very big letters.\n\nWhy?  And why mention it here?\n\nYesterday I went to Wal-Mart by myself to pick up a few things for supper.  Amanda sent me a text reminding me what to get.  If she said “get Dr. Pepper, Milk, Coffee” and then in all capitol letters said “AND DON’T FORGET THE CREAM OF CHICKEN SOUP.”  What would be the point of all caps?\n\nIf you get a letter and at the end of it in 22 point font, all caps, with exclamation points, red ink and underline it says “Make sure you vote on March 20”. What would that mean?  \n\nIt’s obvious, it’s an emphasis.  It means, if you forget everything I wrote, don’t forget this.  What I think Paul is saying here is “Listen, this is so important that I want you to see that I am writing it myself, in my own handwriting, and I’m just in case you miss it, I’m writing it really, really big.”\n\nSo what did Paul want these Galatians not to miss?\n\nLook at the verses 12 and 13.  Remember this whole book was written about these people who claimed to be Christians but who were introducing works to salvation and preaching another gospel.  Notice what Paul says about them:\n\n> *”As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.”*\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here.  Remember, there are only two religions.  There is the religion of “do” and there is the religion of “done.”  There is you trying to get to heaven by your works, or you trying to get to heaven based on Christ’s works.  Do vs. Done.\n\nEvery false religion, every single one of them is a “do” religion.  All of them say “here is what you have to do to please God and get to heaven.”  Mormonism, The Jehovah’s Witnesses, Roman Catholicism, many Christian sects, Islam, Christian Scientists, Hinduism, Bhudism, Taoism, we could go on and on.  All of them are man’s attempts to please God with their own works. \n\nAnd the difference between them and Biblical Christianity is this.  Biblical Christianity says there is no way you are going to please God with you own works.  You can’t do it.  You are broken.  You at your best isn’t good enough to reach God’s standard.  You are a sinner and your sins must be paid for.   But God loved you so much that he sent a substitute to pay your sins for you.  \n\nSo to summarize: the cost of admission into heaven is so high you can’t possibly pay it yourself, and Jesus Christ came and died on the cross to pay it for you.  All you have to do is trust Christ’s work.  It’s not “do” it’s “done.”\n\nThe false teachers in Galatia took the gospel - which is the religion of “done” and they added the works of Judaism to it.  They were telling gentile Christians that they had to be circumcised and that they had to keep the law.  \n\nWhy?  Why do people come up with false religions?  Why do people add works to the gospel?  Why do people insist on a religion of “do?”  Paul answers it here.\n\nBasically, what you have in these closing motivations are ::the motivation of the “doers” vs. the motivation of the “donors”::  \n\nSo that is the outline I’m going to give you this morning.  \n\nLet’s start with \n\n# 1. The motivation of the “doers”\n\nPaul gives us three things that are driving these false-teachers and false-religions:\n\nThe first is \n\n## They do it for achievement.\n\nThey want to “make a fair show in the flesh.”  They want people to be able to look at them and see how holy and how righteous they are.  They want to feel like they have done something.\n\nListen to me folks, beware of any religion that likes to pat itself on the back.  Anytime you feel yourself saying, well I’m a good person, I don’t do this and this and this, and I do this and this and that - that’s not Christianity speaking, it’s pride speaking.\n\nThe easiest thing in the world is to turn Christianity into a bunch of rules.   A lot of people want that.  They just want rules.  They just want me to tell them exactly what to do.  They want a dress code.  They want a bunch of check boxes they can tick off so they can say “look, I’m a good Christian, I do this and this and this.”\n\nIf someone asks you “Why should you go to heaven?” what are you going to say?  Here are some answers I’ve heard:\n\n* Because I was baptized.\n* Because I go to church every Sunday.\n* Because I’ve lived a good life.\n* Because I give to the church.\n* Because I don’t sin like those people do.\n\nAll of those are wrong answers.  All of those are human achievements.  All of those are you trying to work your way into God’s good graces.  They are false religion.\n\nThe second motivation of “do” religion is…\n\n## They do it for approval.\n\nPaul said in verse 12:\n\n> *”only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.”*\n\nThe religion of the cross offends people.  When you tell people they aren’t good enough, it offends them.  When you tell people all of the works they have been working don’t matter, it offends them.\n\nMost people in this world will tolerate a “do” religion.  That makes sense to them.  They’ll approve of that.  But the moment you say that you are a sinner that can’t save himself, then you are offending them.\n\nTurn with me to 1 Corinthians.  1 Corinthians 1 and we are going to read verses 20-25:\n\n> *”[1Co 1:20-25 KJV] 20 Where [is] the wise? where [is] the scribe? where [is] the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? 21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; 24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.”*\n\nThe gospel is an offense.  It’s a stumbling block.  It is too simple for the intellectuals.  It is too easy for the religious folks.  It’s foolishness to them.\n\nIn Paul’s day, if you were a Christian who preached the cross - you would be cut off from your jewish friends and family.  You would be persecuted by the Roman Government.  It was an unpopular position, and these false teachers were trying to soften it a bit so they weren’t as unpopular.  \n\nThey were doing it for approval.\n\nThe last thing they were after is…\n\n## They do it for applause.\n\nLook at verse 13:\n\n> *”For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.”*\n\nThese false teachers weren’t keeping the whole law.  It’s impossible to keep the whole law.  They were failing by their own standards.  But do you know how they got over that - they made converts.\n\nThis is something that a lot of false religions, a lot of “do” religions do.  They go after converts as a way to salve their conscience.   They know they are failures by their own standards, so they go out and get more people to be failures with them.  It’s why the mormons and Jehovah’s witnesses keep knocking on your door.  They need converts so they can have something to brag about.\n\nBut it’s not always converts.  It is always something they can brag about in the flesh.  That’s what the words “glory in” mean.  They mean “something to brag or boast over.”  “Something to pat yourself on the back for.”\n\nThey do it for achievement, approval and applause.  That’s the motivation of the “doers” but what is…\n\n# The Motivation of the “doners”?\nLook at verse 14:\n\n> *”But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.”*\n\nRemember, “glory” means to “boast or brag.”  Paul is saying “I only have one thing to boast or brag about, and it’s the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”\n\nDo you know what a cross is?  We are going to see a lot of crosses this week.  It’s easter week.  You see people with cross tattoos and cross necklaces.  Do you know what a cross is?  It’s an instrument of torture and death.\n\nLiterally, it’s like having a guillotine necklace or an electric chair tattoo.  It’s the most unlikely symbol ever.\n\nSo why do we brag on the cross?  Why do we glory in the cross?  Because the Bible teaches that we can’t save ourselves, we are sinners, and Jesus died on that cross for our sins.  He paid my penalty and he paid yours.  \n\nI want to imagine that there is this beautiful house in your neighborhood. Immaculate lawn.  Beautiful architecture.  I mean, it’s a mansion.  And there is this smiling guy who is always coming out of the house and getting into his Mercedes wearing nice clothes.  And one day you meet him at the mailbox and you say “Man, you must be proud of all of this.”\n\nAnd the guy says “Actually, I have nothing to be proud of.  You see, I was in prison for a crime, I was awaiting my execution, and I was guilty.  Then some man who was completely innocent took my penalty, He died for me and all that you see here, it was given to me by Him.”  I have nothing to be proud of, but I’m sure grateful for that guy, he saved my life.\n\nThat’s the gospel.  We don’t have anything to brag in, besides Christ.  We were guilty, Christ took our penalty on the cross.  Everything good about our life is a gift we don’t deserve.  And if we are going to brag in something, we need to brag in Christ.\n\n## The cross changes our relationship with the world.\n\n> *”by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world”*\n\n## The cross changes our relationship with religion.\n\n> *”For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.”*",

    "body": "# James 1:5-8\nTake your Bibles with me and turn again in the book of James.  Last week I started this series on James and we talked about the purpose of problems and we learned a little bit about this man James.  James was Jesus’ brother, he was a leader in the early church at Jerusalem and He was very, very Jewish in his outlook.\n\nThe big problem facing James was trouble and trials in the church.  Imagine if God sent a great persecution to our town, and people in our church started going to jail for their faith.  Daddies were being separated from their kids.  People were disappearing into gulags in the middle of the night.  That kind of thing has happened all over the world for two thousand years.\n\nImagine if it happened here though.  What would likely happen is you would run for the hills.  (And living in Illinois, you’d have to run really, really far.)  You’d scatter.  \n\nAnd that’s what happened to the church in Jerusalem.  They ran for the hills.  They scattered.  They were facing this terrible trouble and so James wrote this book to teach them and the first thing he was concerned about was trouble and how to handle it.\n\nAnd his lesson was that if you handle trouble right, God will use it to make you mature and complete.  You’ll be *”perfect and entire, wanting nothing.”*. \n\nThat’s what I preached on last Sunday Night.  Now look at our text tonight.  Verse 5 starts with these words:\n\n> *”But if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God...”*\n\nThat’s a tie in.  James is saying - as you face trials, as you endure hardships, as you grow in maturity, there is one thing you are going to need and it is wisdom.\n\nSo last week we talked about trials, tonight we are going to talk about wisdom.  \n\nLet’s read the whole text, verses 5-8:\n\n> *”James 1:5-8 (KJV) 5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all [men] liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. 6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. 7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. 8 A double minded man [is] unstable in all his ways.”*  \n\nOn Wednesday this week, you are going to meet someone who is really special to me.  Pastor Mark Carpenter is going to be in the service.  Pastor Carpenter was my youth pastor when I was a teenager and now he pastors in Columbus, Ohio.  He called and asked if he could come and take me out to supper on Wednesday and just be a part of the service.  I’m really excited about it.\n\nOne thing Pastor Carpenter did for us was make us sing a lot of scripture songs.  He had all of these scriptures put to music which we would sing in Youth Group and one of them was these verses.\n\n(Sing) If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, which giveth to all men, liberally, and upbraideth not and it shall be given him. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.\n\nWhy don’t you try that with me?  (Sing again)\n\nSo what does this passage teach?  I’m going to break it down into three points:\n* The thing we need\n* The source of it\n* The prerequisite \n\nSo lets start with number 1...\n\n# 1. The thing we need: wisdom\nThe passage says *”If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God.”* So the thing we need as we go through the ups and downs of life is wisdom.\n\nWisdom is one of the most used words in the Bible and it means a couple different things:  \n\n**Sometimes wisdom just means knowledge.** Moses was learned in the “wisdom of the egyptians” Jesus grew “in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and man” and later people marveled at Jesus’ wisdom and asked where He learned it.   In\n\n**Sometimes wisdom means the ability to do certain things.** Jesus talked about a “mouth of wisdom” that would be given to us when people ask of us.  Stephen had wisdom to minister in the early church.  \n\n**But most of the time, Christian wisdom is the ability to use the knowledge of God in our day to day life.**  The operative word is USE.  Wisdom is more than knowledge, it is skill to make the right decision moment by moment.  It is skill for living rightly.  It is knowledge with work gloves on.  \n\nThe truth is, we need wisdom.  We need help making decisions day to day:\n* Wisdom in how to spend our time.\n* Wisdom in how to respond to people at work.\n* Wisdom in how we raise our children and discipline them.\n* Wisdom in how we relate to our spouse.\n* Wisdom in what we choose to do in our free time.\n* Wisdom in how we minister for the Lord at church.\n\nAnd we could go on and on and on.  We are faced constantly with all of these choices we have to make.  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them.  And we have to learn to use wisdom.  \n\nAnd it’s a skill.  It almost becomes a habit.  \n\nIt’s hard for most of us to remember this, but if you could rewind to your first time behind the wheel of a car, you were probably terrified.  You had to think about every step.  Step on the gas.  Step on the brake.  Pull back the shifter.  Move it to Drive.  Step on the gas.  Slow down for the car ahead of you.  Put on the blinker.  I’m stressed out just thinking about it.\n\nBut now, you get in the car and you are playing on your phone and eating an ice cream cone from McDonald’s while changing lanes and thinking about what you are going to have for dinner.  You aren’t thinking about driving at all.   Those thoughts turned into a skill and into a habit.  You are making those thousands of decisions on auto-pilot.\n\nAnd the same thing is true about wisdom.  When you learn to make wise decisions, those decisions just become part of your auto-pilot and you don’t have to make them anymore.  They are like functions in software.  Scripts you apply to different situations.  You just do them without thinking.\n\nBut sometimes we have bad habits and bad software.  I’ve told a few of you this, but one of the bad things in my life I am working on now is my relationship to my phone.  Over the last couple of weeks I’ve come to realize that I am really, really addicted to Social Media and to my phone and it’s not good.  It’s a little thing that can ruin my relationship with my wife and my kids and ruin my ability to pastor.  So I’m working on stopping that.  I’m off all social media.  I’ve removed anything I would want to check on my phone.  I’m checking email only at certain times a day.  Because I need to do something drastic to rewrite those bad habits.\n\nSo wisdom is how we apply what we know to make good decisions, and eventually those decisions become our “auto-pilot” and we make a lot of decisions without even thinking about them consciously.  \n\nThe Bible has a lot to say about our common small decisions.  Read the book of proverbs and you’ll find a lot about things like:\n* Time management\n* How we approach work and rest\n* How we approach money\n* How we discipline our kids\n* How we treat and talk to each other\n* How we respond to leadership\n* Who we choose to be our friends\n\nAnd then the Bible has a lot to say about things that are even smaller than this.  Things that happen inside our mind like worry and doubt and fear and lust.   And a big part of wisdom is just kind of installing these truths about how we see the world and make decisions as our auto-pilot software and just letting it make decisions for us.\n\nBut even with that auto-pilot, sometimes we have to be deliberate about our decisions.  Something big comes up, we are faced with some crisis and we don’t know what to do and we know “I am way out of my league here, I need some special guidance and wisdom.”\n\nSo what are we supposed to do in those situations?  Ask of God.\n\nWhich brings us to number 2.  Number one was “what we are after: wisdom” number two is...\n\n# 2. The source of wisdom: the Giving God\nIt says *”If any of you lack wisdom, let Him ask of God that giveth”*\n\nThe words “God that giveth” actually go together.  “That giveth” is a participle.  In English it would be an “ing” word.  Literally, James is calling God “the giving God.”\n\nJames is saying “When you don’t know what to do and you need wisdom, go to the giving God that gives to all men liberally.”\n\nHow many of you have ever heard the expression “He’d give the shirt off of his back”?  That’s the way we describe people who are extremely generous.  \n\nWhat James is saying here is that God is generous as a part of His character.  Just like God is love and God is Holy and God is good.  God is giving.  He is a giver.  He is generous.  \n\nAnd so if you go to God and you ask for wisdom that you need to live the Christian life, He’s going to give it to you.  He’s not going to withold any good thing from you if you ask in faith.\n\nIt’s like what Jesus said in \n\n> *”22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.”*  \n\nAnd in Matthew 6:\n\n> *”Ask and it shall be given, seek and ye shall find, knock and the door shall be opened unto you.”*\n\nGod is a giver.  That’s a part of God’s character.  He is “the giving God.”  If you ask for it, and it’s good for you, He’s going to give it.\n\nAnd it says *“and upbraideth not”* - I think that means God isn’t going to chastise you for asking.\n\nMy daughter Audrey asks me for a snack 1,000 times a day.  I mean, the girl can really, really eat.  If she hasn’t eaten in the last 20 minutes she’s *starving!*  So sometimes, she asks for a snack and it’s annoying and I might upbraid her for asking.\n\nBut God isn’t ever going to upbraid us for asking for wisdom.  We aren’t getting on His nerves.  He wants to give us wisdom and He wants us to ask.\n\nIn fact, He says to us:  *”Ye have not because ye ask not”*. God wants us to bring our requests to Him in prayer, especially when we ask for wisdom and He wants to grant those requests.  We aren’t ticking Him off when we ask.  We aren’t wasting His time.\n\nHe’s the giving God.\n\nSo we’ve seen what we need: wisdom.  And we’ve seen where we get it: the Giving God.  There is one more thing this passage teaches...\n\nVerses 6 through 8 say:\n\n> *”But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering, for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.  For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.  A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”*\n\nWe need wisdom and God wants us to ask for it and give it but there is one prerequisite:\n\n# 3. The one prerequisite: wholeheartedness\nGod wants us to “ask in faith, nothing wavering.”  Put another way, He wants us to be “all in.”  He wants us to be totally committed to following Him.  \n\nWe can’t ask God for wisdom and then go get a second opinion.  That’s not how it works.\n\nSome people go to the doctor and they get a diagnosis.  But they don’t like the diagnosis and so they keep going doctor to doctor till someone tells them what they want to hear.   \n\nGod doesn’t work that way.  When you seek God’s help you have to be all in, totally committed.  You can’t sit on the fence and ask God’s help.  \n\nYou can’t be wishy-washy.  That’s literally what James is saying here: *“he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”*  Wishy-washy.  \n\nWishy-washy Christians don’t get their prayers answered.  God doesn’t want to be option one of fifty-five.  He wants to be it.  Period.  All or nothing.\n\nThey are what Vance Havner used to call “middle-of-the-roaders.”  He used to say:\n\n> The middle of the road is a poor place to walk.  It is a poor place to drive.  It is a poor place to live.\n\nIf you aren’t committed to Christ and wholeheartedly wanting to follow His wisdom, He’s just straight up not going to give it to you.",

I'm the kind of guy who, when he gets his value meal at McDonalds with the sandwich missing, says to himself \"I guess it's God's will for me not to eat a sandwich today.\"  I hate arguing with people and asserting myself.  It's actually probably a character flaw and something I need to work on.\n\nThere are some people on the opposite end of the spectrum.  When we were in New Hampshire, I went into a McDonalds to use the restroom and there was a man at the counter who was literally screaming at the workers because they got his egg mcmuffin wrong.  I thought \"dude, it's an egg mcmuffin - it's not worth risking a heart attack over.\"  But he was angry.\n\nSome people love to fight.  They love to argue.  They are always on the lookout for a fight.\n\nThere are some preachers who are that way.  There is this guy in Arizona who pastors a small church about our size and manages to get in the news all the time because he says off the wall things.  After the Orlando shooting last Sunday (was it only last Sunday) he got up on his pulpit and said \"Good\" and then posted it on youtube.  Can I tell you I run as far away as I can from people like that.\n\nWhat we are going to see in our text this morning is a fight.  It's a theological knockdown - draggout bout.  And there are some really, really interesting things we can learn from it that still apply to us today.  So let's read Acts 15:1-21 together:\n\n> *\"1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, [and said], Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved. 2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question. 3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and [of] the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. 5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command [them] to keep the law of Moses. 6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. 7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Men [and] brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as [he did] unto us; 9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they. 12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. 13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men [and] brethren, hearken unto me: 14 Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, 16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: 17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. 18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. 19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: 20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and [from] fornication, and [from] things strangled, and [from] blood. 21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.\"*\n\nThis passage is one of the most important passages in the book of Acts and it's all about a fight.  It wasn't a fist fight.  No one was physically harmed.  That was never the intention - it was a fight of ideas.\n\nAll we are going to do is work through this passage this morning, and then I want to give you three lessons from it that we can all apply to today.  Before I get into our outline, **let's pray and ask God's blessing on the reading of His Word.**\n\n---\n\nThe first point in our outline is:\n\n# 1. The Problem\n\nLook at verse 1:\n\n> *\"And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.\"*\n\nPaul and Barnabas have been preaching all over the region and there is a group of men from Israel who are going around and they are preaching something new - namely, that you have to be circumcised like a jew if you want to be saved.  \n\nNow, why is that a problem?  \n\nIt's a problem because they are changing the rules of salvation.\n\nWhen I was a kid I played a lot of pickup football at recess.  There was always someone who wanted to make up the rules as he went along.  I'd count my 5 missisippi and then tag the quarterback, and then he'd say \"No, we just changed it, it's ten mississippi now.\"\n\nNothing is more frustrating than when the goal is always moving or the rules are always changing.\n\nBut that's just a game.  Games have very little consequence.  But our salvation is of eternal consequence.  Our salvation is the difference between heaven and hell.  Nothing could be more important. \n\nThere is nothing more important than the question \"What must I do to be saved?\" and if the answer to that question is always changing - then we are in real trouble.\n\nSo these jewish believers come to Paul's area and they start teaching that you have to be circumcised to be saved.  They are adding works to salvation.\n\nLet's look and see what Paul did about it:\n\n# 2. The Response\n\nLook at verse 2:\n\n> *\"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, \"* \n\nThe verse says that Paul and Barnabas sprang to action.  They did something about this false teaching.  They did something about this new doctrine.  Specifically - they had a \"dissension\" and \"disputation\" - what does that mean?\n\nWell, I looked it up and here is what I found.  The word dissension basically means they rose a ruckus.  They made a big deal about this.  They openly resisted this.\n\nThey threw down a flag.  They jumped to their feet and they said \"That's not right - that's wrong.\"  They rose a ruckus.\n\nNow listen to me - too many people are ok with a basketball player raising a ruckus on the court when the call doesn't go his way. They are ok with a politician raising a ruckus when they feel like the government isn't listening to us.  Steph Curry or Rush Limbaugh can contest and protest all they want and no one raises an eye.  But the moment a Christian or a preacher starts saying \"that's not right, that's not fair, that's not what God intended, that's not what the Bible says\"  people get real squirrelly and very uncomfortable. \n\nWhy is that?  Why is it ok to get upset and be vocal about a football game that doesn't matter at all for eternity but it's not ok to get upset and be vocal about false doctrine?\n\nSo they dissented.  It also says they *disputed.*  That just means they had an argument, they had a debate.  They had a battle of ideas.\n\nThese pharisee teachers said \"you have to be circumcised and obey the law to be saved\" and Paul said \"No - no you don't, that's false doctrine and let me tell you why.\"  \n\nBut it doesn't end there.  Look at the verse again:\n\n> *\"When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.\"*\n\nThis brings me to my third point:\n\n# 3. The Appeal\n\nYou see, they couldn't just leave this one hanging.  They had to have an answer about this.  They had to know what was right.  \n\nSo they appealed to the highest order they had - they went to the apostles that were at Jerusalem to see what they had to say about it.\n\nAnd that's what most of this chapter is about - it's telling us the story of how that went.  Let me quickly summarize it for you:\n\nPaul and Barnabas go to Jerusalem and they give a kind of missionary report.  Just like when we have missionaries here that show slides and tell about their ministry in Ghana or whatever, Paul and Barnabas went to this Jerusalem church and gave a report of their ministry in the gentile lands and everyone rejoices about it.\n\nBut then, look at verse 5:\n\n> *\"But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.\"*\n\nSo this group in the Jerusalem church stands up and they say \"now, hold on a minute - it's good that these gentiles are hearing the gospel and all - but we need to make them get circumcised and keep the law of Moses.\"\n\nLast Sunday we had Dr. Riechman here - and that sure was interesting, and he told us about what \"keeping the law of Moses\" meant to these people.  These Pharisees wanted to say that if you didn't go to synagogue, if you didn't wear the phylacteries, if you didn't eat kosher - then you weren't really saved.\n\nAnd this was a big deal.  Because listen, at this point, almost everyone who was a Christian was a jew.  They kept the law of Moses from birth.  They grew up with prejudices about gentiles.  They grew up thinking they were superior.  So when they saw these Gentiles in the church - they acted like some of you act when someone comes in here that has Tattoos all over them and smells like cigarrettes.  They had the \"ick\" factor and they weren't even trying to hide it - they were trying to spiritualize it.\n\nSo this was a problem.  And the apostles got together and they had a debate.  They had a big argument over it.  There was back and forth.  Finally, Peter stands up and says\n\n\"Listen folks, you remember how a little while ago God made it clear to me that God wanted the gentiles to be saved, and then we saw God work in their lives and give them the Holy Ghost.  God put no difference between them and us.  He declared them to be clean.\"\n\n\nAnd he concludes with verse 10:\n\n> *\"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?\"*\n\nIn other words, let's just leave the gentiles alone.  God is obviously doing something there.  This isn't our idea, it's God's idea.  So let's just leave them alone.\n\nThen they talk some more and James talks and they come to this conclusion that you see in verse 20:\n\n> *\"But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.\"*\n\nIn other words - let's not add anything to them. Let's just tell them that after they get saved, they need to avoid idolatry and fornication.  They need to stay sexually pure and stay away from idols.\n\nOk.  So this happened.  We have the record of it.  We can see this theological fight going on here.  What do we learn from it today?\n\nI think there are four lessons that we should learn from this:\n\n# 4. Lessons:\n\nThe first lesson is this:\n\n## A. Some things are worth arguing over.\n\nThere are lots of people today who call themselves Christians who absolutely refuse to take stand on anything.  They say things like \"doctrine divides\" and they talk a lot about \"unity.\"  Their watchword is \"don't ever make a ruckus, don't ever call foul, leave it up to God.\"\n\nCan I tell you church, that might sound good - but it's a cop-out.  It's totally unbiblical.  In the New Testament, whenever false doctrine was taught - especially when it was something about salvation - it was war. The fight was on.\n\nThe book of Jude commands us to *\"earnestly contend for the faith once given to the saints.\"*\n\nPaul tells us that we are to *\"Mark them that cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine that you have learned and avoid them.\"*\n\nIn several places he says about people preaching a false gospel *\"let them be anathama.\"*  In one place the Bible says *\"Don't even wish them godspeed.\"*  In other words, don't even give them a cordial greeting.\n\nPeople don't like that.  It doesn't sound nice.  But make no mistake about this - it's biblical.  It's all over the New Testament.   You can either take a stand for the truth or you can be an unbiblical disobedient Christian.  Those are our options.\n\nAnd let me tell you - the world might not call that nice - but it's really the nicest thing you can do.  When someone is poisoning themselves - they may not want to hear about it - but there is nothing nice about letting them drink poison.  The Doctor in the third world country might not want to hear about anesthetic and hand washing - but letting him go on killing people isn't being nice.\n\nWe have to contend for the faith. Some things are worth arguing over.\n\nThe second lesson I think we can apply to today is:\n\n## B. You can find certainty in apostolic doctrine.\n\nWhen the church had a problem they couldn't answer - where did they look?  They looked to the apostles.  They looked to the teaching of that special group of men that walked with Jesus and they got a definitive answer.\n\n Now, we don't have a group of apostles that we can appeal to today - but we still have the apostles teaching - it's called \"The New Testament\" and we can still appeal to it and to the rest of the Bible to find certainty.\n\nLet me tell you church - the very idea of truth is under attack today.   People say things like \"That may be true for you, but it's not true for me.\"  and \"It's not about the truth, it's about a conversation.\"  Every cultural fight in our country right now springs from an attack on the notion of truth.  And there are people who hate the idea of absolute certainty and absolute truth and absolute moral right and wrong.\n\nBut just pretending like something isn't the truth - doesn't make it stop being the truth.  We have the truth church - it's right here.  One of our baptist distinctives is that this book is \"the sole authority for our faith and practice.\"  When we take a question or a truth to examine it in the light of the scriptures - we are doing exactly what Paul and Barnabas and the believers did in the first century.\n\nAnd we will find certainty here.\n\nTwo more lessons...\n\n## C. Whenever you add something to the gospel you destroy it.\n\nI want you to notice that these false teachers - they didn't take anything AWAY from the gospel.  They wanted the GOSPEL AND JUDAISM.  But by adding Judaism to the gospel, they destroyed the gospel.\n\nDo you know why that is?  The gospel is about the grace of God.  It's a free gift.  It's not of works - lest any man should boast.  It's all God's free gift and none of ours.  Whenever we say \"To be save you have to believe AND\"  Whenever we add that AND we destroy the gospel.  Because the AND makes it stop being a free gift.  \n\nSo the gospel plus morals is no gospel.\nThe gospel plus works is no gospel.\nThe gospel plus church membership is no gospel.\nThe gospel plus culture is no gospel.\n\nIt has to stand by itself, as soon as we tell people there is something they must do ON TOP OF believing the gospel to be saved we fundamentally change what the gospel is.\n\nAnd that brings me to my last lesson:\n\n## D. Salvation is by grace - and we have to guard that with everything we have.\n\nI want to close by having you turn to another passage of scripture.  This is a passage that most likely was written by Paul as a response to this episode in Acts.  So this is talking about the same thing Acts is talking about.  Look at Galatians 1:8-12\n\n> *\"[Gal 1:8-12 KJV] 8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any [man] preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. 10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. 11 But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. 12 For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught [it], but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.\"\"\n\nChurch - the gospel matters.  We've got to get the gospel right and we've got to fight for it with everything we have.\n\n----\n\nMaybe there is someone here this morning that's been hearing about \"the gospel\" but you've never had a time in your life when you believed the gospel and were saved by the grace of God....\n",

    "body": "Tonight, I'm back in Genesis.  I've been back for weeks, but I haven't got back in Genesis yet.  Tonight we are going to look at one of my favorite passages in this chapter.  Let's read chapter 15 together:\n\n> *\"1 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I [am] thy shield, [and] thy exceeding great reward. 2 And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house [is] this Eliezer of Damascus? 3 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 4 And, behold, the word of the LORD [came] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. 7 And he said unto him, I [am] the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. 8 And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 9 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 10 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 11 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 12 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land [that is] not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites [is] not yet full. 17 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. 18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, 20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims, 21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\"*\n\nThis is an interesting chapter.  It's a very important chapter.  It's the basis for much of what we see in the Paul's writings about faith.  \n\nIt's a chapter with a lot of firsts: \n\n* It's the first time in the bible you see the phrase \"The word of the Lord came.\"  Now, you are going to see it a lot later - but this is the first reference to the word of the Lord.   \n* It's the first time in the Bible you see God referred to as a shield.  Again, you see that a lot in the scripture - about 20 times.  We sing about how God is a mighty fortress.  That idea starts  in this chapter.\n* It's the first time that a person is commanded to \"fear not\" in the Bible.  That command appears 63 times in the Bible, more than any other command and it is found first here.\n\nBut probably the most important thing we see first in this passage is the word **\"believe\".**\n\nAbraham is called \"the father of faith\" for a reason.  In the New Testament, when Paul was making his case for salvation by faith he said \n\n> \"For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.\"\n\nBelieved.  That's an important part of it.  So this is a special chapter.  We are just going to focus tonight on the first couple verses of it.  We'll probably look at the rest of it next week.\n\n\n***So let's pray and I'll give you three points about it.***\n\nThis chapter starts with God coming to Abraham and saying *Abram, fear not.*\n\nSo, point number 1 -\n\n# 1. The Problem:\n\nAnd the problem was fear.  Fear.\n\nApparently, Abram was afraid.  \n\nNow, humanly speaking, he had good reason to be scared.  Let me give you two of them:\n\n## A. Fear of powerful enemies\n\nRemember what happened in the last chapter?  He took on Chadalaemer - the warrior king.  He, one guy with his small band of soldiers, took on his era's equivalent of Alexander the Great or Napaleon and won.  Chadalaemer must have been steamed and Abraham probably feared that this super powerful guy would come back with a vengeance - wouldn't you?  \n\nBut I think there was a second thing that Abram was fearing at this point in his life and it was:\n\n\n## B. Fear of empty promises.\n\nHold your finger here and turn back to chapter 12.  God tells Abram to get out of Ur and follow Him and Abram does.  He doesn't do it right away. But he does.\n\nThen, in verse 2 look what God says to Abram:\n\n> *\"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:\"* (2)\n\nSo, God had promised Abram that He would make his name great and that He would bless him and make him into a great nation.\n\nThen look down at verse 7:\n\n> *\"And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.\"* (7)\n\nHere God reiterates this promise but adds that God would give his seed the land.\n\nAlright, fast forward back to chapter 15.  It's been something like 15-25 years.  Abraham is an old man, Sarah is an old woman and they still have no child.\n\nSo God had promised land to Abram's seed - but at this point Abram is too old and he still doesn't have any seed.  Every promise of God at this point seems like a sham.\n\nAnd Abram is alone in the desert on a starry night mulling all of this over.  Of course he was afraid.  He probably was doubting.\n\n---\n\nSo that's the problem.  Let's look at point 2 -\n\n\n# 2. The answer:\n\nLook at verse 1 again:\n\n> *\"After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, \"*\n\nDo you know what I love about this?  God came to Abram.  God looked down from heaven and saw that His child was in a time of need, God looked into the head of Abram and saw what was there and God said \"This man needs some help\" and God came to Him.\n\nGod does that sometimes.  We ought to rush to Him, but sometimes He beats us there.\n\nNotice what God says - these words are powerful:\n\n> *\"Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.\"*\n\nHe says Fear not!  \n\nWhy Abram?  Why fear not?  What possible reason do you have to not fear?\n\n> *Fear not, Abram, I.*\n\nHere is the amazing thing.  Fear is the problem in this passage.  Do you know what the answer is?  It's God.  Just God.  The person and character of God.\n\nWhy shouldn't you fear?  Why is fear not repeated 63 times in the scripture?  God.  It's because of WHO He is we can get through trials.  It's Him.\n\nSpecifically, though, God wanted Abram to know two things about Himself. First, \n\n## A. God was Abram's Shield.\n\nDo you know what God was saying there?  You could sum it up in three simple words \"I'm protecting you.\"  I'm watching out for you.  I'm your bodyguard.  I've got your back.\n\nWhen you walk with God you are walking around with the greatest insurance plan you could ever have.  You may be in good hands with All-state but that's nothing like the protection of being in God's hands.  You can walk into war zones in God's will and be totally untouchable.  You can get thrown into a fiery furnace so hot the people who throw you in die of heat and come out unscathed if you are under God's protection.  You can have the armies of this world descend upon you and be totally calm because the armies of God are descending on them and it's no contest.\n\nWe can say like Paul in Romans 8:\n\n> *\"For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\"*\n\nBecause you are in God's hands.  He is your shield.\n\nThe second thing God wanted Abram to know about Himself was...\n\n## B. God was Abram's Exceeding Great Reward.\n\nNow, Abram was thinking about the promise of God - the land, the children, the nation.  All of that.  But God said to Abram - no \"I am your reward.\"\n\nI love how a preacher named F.B. Meyer from the 1800s put it:\n\n> \"Come now, my child, and think; even if thou wert never to have one foot of soil, and thy tent were to stand silent, amid the merry laughter of childish voices all around -- yet thou wouldest not have left thy land in vain, for thou hast Me. Am not I enough? I fill heaven and earth; cannot I fill one lonely soul? Am not I 'thy exceeding great reward'; - F.B. Meyer\n\nIn other words - listen - even if God gives you nothing else but Himself - He's given you more than anything you could ever even ask for.\n\nMost of the time, God blesses His followers.  Proverbs says *\"I have not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread.\"*  The book of Luke says *\"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.\"*  Jesus promised his disciples *\"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.\"*\n\nSometimes God's will is for us to go through times of poverty and hardship, but most of the time God blesses those who follow Him.  But listen, if you get nothing.  No financial blessing, nor family blessing.  Nothing besides a walk with God - you've still got the deal of a lifetime.\n\nSo God was reminding Abram of this.  Abram had God.  He had a relationship with God. God was looking out for Him and taking care of Him.  Don't fear, I'm here.\n\n# 3. The promise:\n\nSo Abram listens, and while He's talking to God, He addresses the elephant in the room. He asks \"What about the promise of a child?  You promised me that, and I have no son, all I have is a steward, is He supposed to be my heir?\"\n\nLook at God's answer (in verse 4-6):\n\n> *\"[Gen 15:4-6 KJV] 4 And, behold, the word of the LORD [came] unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 6 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\"*\n\nGod said \"No, no, no Abram.  You are getting ahead of yourself. I'm going to give you more natural offspring than you could possibly count.  Look at all of those stars - you'll have more offspring than that.\"\n\nWe know the rest of the story.  God did.  Abram was old - way too old. But God worked a miracle.  \n\nThe lesson from that is this:\n\n> We often mistake God's delays as denials.\n\nSometimes we think God is saying \"No\" when God is just saying \"not yet.\"  \"Wait a little while.\"  Trust me, I know what I'm doing.\n\nAs a parent, sometimes my kids want to know every detail.  When are we leaving, what way are we going, what stops are we making, who are we going to see.  Amanda has a saying, she says \"Ride the bus.\"  That means \"Just trust me, I've got a plan, just go along.\"\n\nSometimes God says to us \"Just ride the bus, the ride might take a little longer than you think it should, but I know exactly what I'm doing.\"\n\nAnd church - never forget this - God knows exactly what He's doing.  His plan for you is perfect.  You might not like every stop on the itinerary. You might have to deal with the cancer stop - didn't plan on that.  Maybe you stop at a place called divorce - didn't want to go there.  Maybe you have to go through poverty - or lonliness - or whatever and you say \"God, are you shure you know where you are going?\" It might not be what you expected.  But ride the bus.  Trust God.  He wants what is best for you and He has a plan for you.\n\nThe last point this evening is:\n\n# 4. The response:\n\nLook at verse 6:\n\n> *\"And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.\"* (6)\n\n\n",
